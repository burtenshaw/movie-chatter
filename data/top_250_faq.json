When Borden comes up with an act that he calls \"The Transported Man,\" in which he bounces a ball across the stage before stepping through a door and instantly reappears from a second door on the opposite side of the stage to catch the ball, Angier becomes obsessed with finding out how the trick works. He seeks out famed inventor Nikola Tesla ('David Bowie' (qv)) who claims to have developed a teleporter but that the machine doesn't seem to work. Angier discovers that the machine actually does work but as a duplicator, not as a teleporter. Each time the machine is used, it creates a duplicate of the item being teleported and deposits that duplicate elsewhere. Angier obtains a Tesla machine and begins using it in his act, which he calls \"The New Transported Man,\" provoking Borden's interest in learning how Angier is accomplishing his act."], ["Is \"_The Prestige_ (qv)\" based on a book?", "_The Prestige_ (qv) is a 1995 novel by British author Christopher Priest. The novel was adapted for the movie by film-making brothers, Jonathan and Christopher Nolan. Christopher Nolan also directed the film."], ["Who or what is the \"Prestige?\"", "Cutter describes every magic trick as having a three-act structure which consists of the pledge, the turn, and the prestige. The pledge is \"a magician shows you something ordinary.\" The turn is that he makes it seem to do something extraordinary, disappear, levitate, transform etc. The prestige ( \"..the hardest part..\") is the payoff, the reward of the trick for the audience. In a trick like sawing a woman in half, the prestige is reconnecting her. In the central trick of the film, the prestige is when someone appears across the stage or theater having previously disappeared. This three act structure of a trick was invented for the film and is not based on actual terminology used by real life magicians. In the novel on which the film is based, the prestige is the spirits of the duplicate Angiers."], ["Was Nikola Tesla a real person?", "Yes. Nikola Tesla [1856-1943] was a Serbian scientist and inventor who is often called \"the father of physics\" for his major contributions in the fields of electricity and electromagnetism, including invention of alternating current (AC) electrical power. However, his eccentric personality and his bizarre claims about possible scientific and technological developments also earned him the title of \"mad scientist,\" and he died impoverished at the age of 86. Tesla's later years saw him pursuing more and more unusual applications of technology, with many rumored goals including anti-gravity, death rays, and teleportation. None of these pursuits, however, were ever actualized."], ["What is the connection between Angier and Lord Caldlow?", "Angier and Lord Caldlow are the same person, as he explains near the end of the movie. Early in the film, Angier's wife Julia ('Piper Perabo' (qv)) says that he is living a double life. Angier responds to this by saying that he only did that to \"spare my family the embarrassment of my theatrical interests.\" Angier had been born to the aristocratic Caldlow family. He adopted the identity of Robert Angier because he wanted to pursue a career in magic and such a career would have embarrassed his aristocratic family. At the end of the film he simply reclaims his original identity. At his wife's suggestion of calling himself \"The Great D'Anton\", he seems to takes offense at being associated with the French. This suggestion would likely be more of an insult to an Englishman rather than an American in the period in which the film is set. Also, during his wife's funeral Angier's accent noticeably slips from American to English, providing a further clue to his real identity."], ["What were Borden's last words?", "Right before Borden is hanged he says \"Abracadabra\", a subtle comment to the audience. He is referring to the 'magic' which unfolds in the very next scene, when Borden's twin appears in front of Angier."], ["What is the name of the song during the end credits?", "\"Analyse\" by Thom Yorke, from his album \"The Eraser\"."], ["Who played Root?", "Angier and Root are both played by 'Hugh Jackman' (qv). For Root, Jackman's appearance was modified using a dental prosthesis and false earlobes (Angier, like Jackman, has attached earlobes and Root has unattached ones). Jackman's nose also appears to have been altered. Trick photography was used when Angier and Root appeared together. When one or the other was seen only from the rear - a double was used."], ["What were the words mumbled by Root while rehearsing onstage?", "They were from Harry Percy (Hotspur) in Shakespeare's Henry IV Part 1. Appearing before the king to explain his failure to turn over prisoners in a recent battle, he claims \"My liege, I did deny no prisoners, but I remember, when the fight was done....\" Why this quote? The quotation lends credibility to the characterization of Angier's double as a classical actor, plucked from the ranks of out-of-work actors to play his part. This particular speech is actually known to be 'Hugh Jackman' (qv)'s set piece that he sometimes used to audition for parts."], ["What did Cutter mean when he told the judge that the machine is real and has no trick?", "He means exactly what he says. In the world of stage magic which Cutter lives in, a \"trick\" involves a magician appearing to make something do the impossible or supernatural. The machine has no trick. It actually does what it appears to do. Of course, at this point Cutter does not know that the machine is a duplicator and instead believes it is a teleporter."], ["Why did Borden send Angier to Tesla? What did he mean by \"Tesla is the key to my diary but not my trick\"?", "As he reveals in his diary, Borden sends Angier to Tesla as part of a wild goose chase. He intends this to remove his main rival from the stage, figuratively and literally, thus allowing Borden to consolidate his status as the top magical performer in London. As for Borden's line \"Tesla is the key to my diary but not to my trick\", he means exactly what he says. \"Tesla\" is the key to solving the cypher which Borden's diary is written in, but Tesla has nothing to do with how the Bordens perform their trick. Borden simply commissioned Tesla to build him a fancy box that shoots electrical charges for show; it had no real function."], ["Why did Angier only perform 100 shows?", "This question is not explicitly answered within the film. One explanation is that by limiting it to a finite number of shows, Angier intended to force Borden's hand. He knew that Borden would be curious about how he did his trick. But if he had an unlimited number of shows then Borden could always put off trying to figure out how it was done. By limiting the performance to only 100 shows, Angier ensured that Borden would eventually either have to act or be forever in the dark. Angier may also have worried that his will to step into the box, and risk certain death, would flag over time. Limiting the number of shows also limits the possibility that he would eventually chicken out."], ["When Borden shows up at the show, how does Angier know not to appear in the balcony?", "The answer is not fully spelled out in the film but the obvious answer seems to be that Angier recognized Borden when the latter came on stage to \"inspect\" the machinery. Since the duplicate has all the knowledge of the original, the Angier who was created knew not to appear. We do see a flashback, seemingly from Angier's perspective, looking down from the balcony onto the audience and hearing Borden screaming for the key. This would only confirm that Angier should disappear, as it was long after he should have appeared to the audience."], ["Why didn't Angier just use one duplicate? Why keep killing them?", "Angier's final shows of the Transported Man are all geared around framing Borden. He wants Borden to be caught backstage with a version of Angier drowning. Since he can't know which night Borden would show up, Angier has to actually perform the act each night and actually kill one of his duplicates. It can also be argued that Angier couldn't bear to share the spotlight with anyone - even himself. This is shown when he takes his bow under the stage while using Root as a double."], ["What is the twist at the end of the film?", "The film actually has two twists, one for each of the rival storylines and how the trick is performed, each of which is revealed near the end of the film: The Borden twist is that Borden and Fallon are a pair of identical twins who take turns as each persona, switching whenever the trick is done. Hence, each time we see a character we used to think of as \"Borden\" since the beginning of the movie, it was one or the other person, each with his own personality, points of view, privity to certain situations, etc... Which is why when writing on his diary about the day he was asked by Angier which knot did he tie Julia with, he says that one half of him swears that he tied a simple slipknot while the other half is convinced that he used the Langford double. The Angier twist is that Tesla never was able to fix the teleporter he tried to create. Angier was using the machine as a teleporter for the trick, but each time one of two resulting Angiers fell through a trapdoor during the performance and drowned in the water tank."], ["Why did Cutter betray Angier in the end?", "Cutter's motivations are never detailed in the film, either at the end or even during the trial. Thus, his motivations are probably varied and contain elements of several possibilities:\n\n(1) Cutter may have felt betrayed by Angier. Angier kept the secret of the trick from him and on some level he probably also felt like he was used by Angier. In Cutter's discovery that Angier was not dead, he seemed to realize the real secret of the machine and would have been angry at Angier for allowing Borden to hang.\n\n(2) Cutter may have felt guilty for his part in Borden's hanging (not being honest in the trial about not really knowing the trick, not asking the stagehands what really happened at every performance, and claiming that Borden was just watching Angier drown) turned to anger at Angier.\n\n(3) Cutter's motivation may have been to get the machine for himself, presumably to make some money on it. He lied on the stand that he had the rights to sell the machine. When it became clear that he was not going to get the machine to sell (he did not even get the watertank), he tried to buy the machine. Since one of the Borden twins was dead, with Angier dead, he would be the only one with a teleportation trick.\n\n(4) Cutter may have been trying to get the machine in order to destroy it; he seems suspicious and somewhat disturbed by it, although this may have been an act on his part, as he is never shown to have reservations about the danger while Angier is alive.\n\n(5) Finally, Cutter may have had elements of a more noble motivation. Cutter did not seem pleased that Angier had taken Jess away from her father and Cutter may even have felt he could have done more to prevent Borden from hanging just to keep the secret.\n\n(6) Cutter didn't exactly betray Angier. At the end Cutter realized how the competition between Angier and Borden was so toxic and was affecting everyone around them. Sarah committed suicide, Olivia was caught in a love triangle between the two men before finally leaving, now Borden's daughter was to be left in the care of Angier after Angier let Borden hang. That was probably too much for Cutter to take as he believes Borden's daughter should be with her father. So Cutter decides once and for all that he wasn't going to be involved in their competition anymore and simply washed his hands of the situation by walking past Borden, knowing full well what would probably happen to Angier. Cutter probably knew all along or at least suspected that Borden had a twin brother because he was adamant that the \"teleporting man\" trick had to be done with a double.\n\nBecause Cutter is our narrator. He knows all along that Borden uses a double, and he feels that Angier has crossed the line, and worse, has made a huge moral change. We must remember that it was Angier who claimed no interest in \"killing doves\", but by the end of the film, is prepared to watch any number of people die to serve his ends. Cutter sees this, and sees that Angier has lost it. As narrator, he needs to be trustworthy to the audience, and thus takes the role of social and moral centre who brings to a close the one \"right\" solution. Return the child to her father."], ["How closely does the film follow the novel?", "Those who have both seen the movie and read the book say that the two are quite different. There are some themes and ideas taken from the novel and many of the same character names are used, but the story is very different and even the characters themselves are different individuals. The book is set up as a mysterious frame narrative in a contemporary setting from the point of view of descendants of each of the magicians, and we learn about the rivalry through diary entries read by the descendants as well as their personal experiences and discoveries.\n\nMajor plot points were completely changed: Julia does not die; Sarah does not die; Borden is not hanged. (He is not even convicted, tried, or accused of killing Angier); Borden and Angier are not colleagues, they barely know each other; Borden does not kill Angier; Cutter is only a minor character. Cutter convinces Angier relatively early in the novel that the Bordens are identical twins. Later, Angier investigates the birth records and discovers that there is no record of a twin. (Albert has a brother, Freddy, who is 2 years younger, but a photo shows that they look nothing alike, having different builds and facial features. In the novel, this is revealed to have been doctored, and that they had planned their trick from an early age.)\n\nAnother major change deals with the Tesla machine. In the novel, the machine is clearly shown to be a teleportation device, but does not create living duplicates. The item or person in the machine is teleported to a new location and inert material that looks like the original is left behind (in the novel, Angier refers to these as \"the prestige materials\"). The prestige materials do not decompose over time, even after a century, but remain exactly as the were at the moment of duplication. The only time two living duplicates are created in the novel is when an incomplete transfer occurs after Borden turns the machine off in mid-teleport. Most of Angier stays behind, but a small mass (he is viewed as a ghostly image) is teleported. There are two distinct minds (with similar memories) with very different bodies. The teleportation device becomes Angier's way to immorally improve his position in society, because, against Tesla's warnings, he uses it almost entirely to create duplicate gold coins, and sometimes paper money amassing a fortune for his family.\n\nAt the end of the novel, Angier is in fact still alive, in this ghostly form, even a century after the novel's main Victorian events. The novel even suggests that there is some psychic link between the teleported body and the prestige, suggesting that they think and feel the same to some extent. It makes the ending of the novel more haunting as we imagine he may have lost a part of his \"soul\" with each teleportation.\n\nThe end of the novel in fact verifies that the prestige material (the duplicate body) while rigid and immobile, possess a soul. Only one person other than Angier is transported, and this is a child we learn is speaking telepathically with the main narrator of the novel, the grandson of Borden. The \"ghost\" version of Angier asks him, are you leaving, or staying here with him. Obviously suggests that he is aware that these prestige materials have souls."], ["What does Tesla's machine do?", "The movie does not explicitly answer this. The consensus interpretation is that the Tesla machine, whatever it was designed to do, results in two identical copies of an object or person (including memories, personalities, etc). One remains in the Tesla machine, and the other is either created or deposited a short distance away. Angier's lack of knowledge on its workings is part of his character's journey/development. There are four main possibilities: (1) The original stays in the machine and a duplicate is created at the destination, (like a fax machine) (2) the original is teleported and a duplicate is created within the machine, (Angier went to Tesla for a teleporting machine) (3) the original is destroyed and 2 copies are created, one in the machine and the other at the destination, [A variant of 1,2, & 3 is that instead of the machine creating the copy, the machine pulls the copy from a similar \"quantum reality\"] (4) some suggest that the machine may randomly switch between the first two option each time it's used (Tesla says \"exact science is not an exact science\") For example, one time the duplicate might be left in the machine and the next time the trick is performed, the duplicate might be the one to show up elsewhere. What is important is that Angier doesn't know. He says as much when he talks about not knowing if he'd be the man in the box or the prestige. This is intended to indicate just how identical each version of Angier is, including all his memories, character etc."], ["Can Tesla's machine be calibrated to choose the destination?", "The novel explains that it is possible for the teleported man to indicate where he will show up. In the film, however, the cats and hats all appear at one spot during Tesla's experiments. Angier never appears at multiple sites, or as far from the machine as the hats and cats. Some viewers have concluded that the mass of the object may be related to the distance of the projection. In one scene, however, Tesla's assistant Alley ('Andy Serkis' (qv)) mentions \"calibration,\" suggesting that it is possible to adjust the \"destination.\" He is later said to have written Angier a detailed set of instructions, and when Angier first tests the machine, we see him making a chalk mark on the floor. Presumably he's testing the calibration and making sure the teleported Angier appears at the location he's tried to set. It's also notable that Angier's first double appeared significantly closer to the machine than the subsequent ones who appeared behind the audience during the shows."], ["Where does the new matter for the duplication come from?", "The question is not answered or even alluded to within the film. Some theories that have been suggested are that the new matter could be created from the machine by converting electricity that powers the machine into mass. The new matter could be pulled from the \"air\" (that doesn't exist) or some alternate universe / quantum reality. It is even possible that the machine transmutes some of the mass from the destination (or the machine) into new material. Some viewers have suggested that Angier could be split into two identical beings, each with half the matter of the original Angier. Others have suggested that the machine may just be a prop in an illusion done by Angier, and that the scene with the double being shot is merely Angier thinking of lying to Borden about the machine as the scene is shown in flashback.\n\nIn the end, there is no provable physics that would account for this duplication. But this is not really the gist of the whole film. The idea is that people will see \"Magic\" where they want to; as Cutter tells Jess, \"You want to be surprised.\" The average person will not care or understand the reason, especially anything remotely scientific, behind a magic trick. This is why the science (not that there is any) is skirted when it comes to transportation. People don't care. The main point is fooling them. It may also be an allegory for the way in which Tesla's very real science about alternating current as superior was hamstrung by Edison and Westinghouse, in their greed, thus reducing a very real physics application (which we now use universally, by the way), to a parlor trick. Just so, Cutter (by sympathising with Borden?) eventually dismisses Tesla's machine and Angier's \"Transported Man\" as tricks."], ["If Tesla was so short of funds, why didn't he simply use the machine to duplicate precious items like gold, jewels, or banknotes?", "This is never answered in the movie, nor is it even a part of the film. Just because the real Tesla died poor, however, does not mean that the fictional Tesla did. In the fantasy world of the movie, perhaps Tesla did use a Tesla machine to live in the lap of luxury or provide funds for research for the rest of his life. He had the perfect source; all he had to claim was that he had a gold mine. The movie indicates that people had come to this area at this time for gold prospecting. Duplicating banknotes would have been not only been illegal but unethical since banknotes have no intrinsic value. Duplicating gold, jewels, or other items with intrinsic value would neither be illegal nor unethical. Another possibility is that this is a clue that machine did not duplicate at all, but was just a prop that Tesla sold as a con.\nOne other explanation is that the process of creating such a machine was so unpredictable that he would be simply unsure whether he could create another. The duplication aspect was a glitch rather than being part of the design. The one duplication machine that he had ultimately did not belong to him."], ["Is Borden a Twin or a Clone?", "Borden, as he explains at the end of the film, is a natural born twin. Other than his word there are several bits of evidence for this. First, Borden is seen to bilocate when he is a struggling magician working in basements. At that point he never could have paid for the duplication machine. Secondly, when Tesla creates the machine he is stymied as to how it works, something which he would not be if he had created one previously. Furthermore, when confronted by Angier, Alley confirms that Tesla never made the machine for another magician before. Most importantly, when the Bordens see Angier's final show they are totally stymied as to how he does his trick and completely shocked when he shows up alive after he drowned. If they had been duplicates then they would have immediately known, or at least suspected, that Angier was using a duplication machine, especially since they were the ones who sent Angier to Tesla. Another way to tell that the Bordens are natural twins is that they have distinctive personalities. One of them, the Borden hanged by the end of the film, is very rash and hot-headed. The one who lives and is reunited with his daughter is much more reserved, honest, and is willing to accept defeat to end the feud."], ["Are there alternative explanations for the tricks performed by Borden and Angier?", "The question and answers presented above deal with what is portrayed within the film and as suggested by the film's creators. However, there has been considerable discussion and debate about possibilities not presented within the film. Following are some alternative theories."], ["Are there alternative theories for Borden's trick?", "One alternative theory is that Borden at some point learns about the existence of Tesla's machine and creates a duplicate of his own, which he then uses to do \"The Transported Man\" trick and with whom he shares the \"Bernard Fallon\" persona."], ["Are there alternative theories for Angier's trick?", "The surprising answer is yes. Many of the things presented within the film can be viewed as ambiguous, even though most do not see it as the intent of the filmmakers. In interviews, it has been suggested that the movie is meant to be ambiguous. There is an article here which supports the premise of the idea of alternate interpretations:As he wrote, [Jonathan] Nolan never shied away from letting the audience draw their own conclusions about all that is going on in the raging battle between Angier and Borden. I love contentious stuff, he admits. Chris and I still argue about aspects of Memento and we've had arguments about _The Prestige_ (qv) as well. I think if you get to the point where people are sitting around a table arguing about what your movie means, then you've done your job as a writer.  Some of the more popular theories involve whether or not the machine actually duplicates since there is nothing within the film that requires a working duplicator; everything can be explained presuming the machine is simply a prop. Thus there are some who believe that Nolan intended the twist to be that the machine is a prop. Others believe that the entire film is meant to be a debate and changes interpretation on how you see the film, like a perception illusion."]], "0018455": [["A Note Regarding Spoilers", "The following FAQ entries may contain spoilers.

There is just a truthfulness and an honesty about the performance.\" Larson prepared for the role by researching the physiological and psychological effects of being stuck in one place for seven years.

However, Castellano demanded too much money to return and, in addition, wanted his girlfriend at the time to rewrite his dialogue. Rather than give in, Coppola wrote out Clemenza, explaining that he'd died in the intervening time between Parts I and II, and replaced him with his Lieutenant, Frankie Pentangeli ('Michael V.

Who killed Johnny Ola's gunmen?", "It may have been implied that Fredo betrayed Michael by opening the bedroom drapes to give Johnny Ola's ('Dominic Chianese' (qv)) hitmen a better view into the room. It's been suggested that once Fredo realized that the hitman had attempted to kill Michael and Kay, Fredo killed the gunmen. (According to Fredo's wife, their bodies were found right outside her and Fredo's room.) This is unlikely because Fredo gets the phone call from Johnny Ola informing him of what happened. Fredo seemed completely unaware of the situation. Fredo later explains to Michael that Hyman Roth ('Lee Strasberg' (qv)) and Ola had assured him it was not going to be an actual hit, just a ruse to frighten Michael into being more cooperative in his business negotiations. That much is probably true, although Fredo also makes it clear that he relished the opportunity to operate on his own, independent of Michael. To Michael, Fredo's act of betrayal is straightforwardly unforgivable, regardless of motive and regardless of whether Fredo had been deceived."], ["Who killed the prostitute found in senator Pat Geary's bed?", "Al Neri ('Richard Bright' (qv)). As Hagen arrives to talk with Senator Pat Geary ('G.D. Spradlin' (qv)) to explain his situation, Neri appears in the doorway and Hagen beckons with his head for him to go away. This is corroborated on the bonus disc of the newly-restored Godfather release on Blu-ray/DVD, where a \"Crime Organization Chart\" is given explaining all characters and their crimes. Under Neri, it states that he killed the prostitute that was with Senator Pat Geary. It is also confirmed by Coppola himself during the director's commentary track on the DVD. Coppola had previously received much criticism for allegedly \"glorifying the mafia\". On the commentary, he mentions that the scene with the dead prostitute is to remind the audience that members of the Cosa Nostra are as ruthless as they are honorable. It shows that they would not hesitate to have Neri kill an innocent girl just to put pressure on a senator."], ["Why did Roth betray Michael?", "There are several possible reasons. Though not explicitly stated, it is implied that Roth wanted revenge for the death of Moe Greene ('Alex Rocco' (qv)), a friend of his who was assassinated on Michael's orders in the previous film. He is visibly angry with Michael when they are discussing Greene. A second reason might be that Michael is getting too much power and influence at the expense of other powerful mobsters, including Roth himself, so they try to kill him. When that fails, Roth tries to cripple Michael's business through Pentangeli's testimony at the senate hearing. Lastly, Michael is reluctant to invest in Roth's Cuban business, whereas Fredo seems much more interested. Just as in the first film, killing the Don or otherwise removing him from his seat of power, will make his next in line Don\u2014in this case, Fredo\u2014who seems much more inclined to continue business with Roth and who can be easily controlled and manipulated."], ["Why did Vito secure a deal with Fanucci if he already had the intention to kill him?", "Probably just to see if he could. Vito eventually turns out as the head of his own crime organization, because he is the one to realizes that power cannot only be based on violence alone; it depends as much on persuasion, gaining respect and loyalty. He knew that Fanucci's ('Gastone Moschin' (qv)) reign was primarily based on bluffs and intimidation, rather than a large, strong organisation backing him (there was even a deleted scene showing Fanucci getting attacked and wounded by a group of street kids, which showed how weak Fanucci actually was). Killing Fanucci would solve most of his problems, but it would be the easy way out. Vito wants to see if he can bargain with Fanucci, and persuade him to cut down on his demands. In other words: he does not simply want to give in to Fanucci's intimidation tactics, but prove that he dares to stand up to him from a vulnerable position. The tactic works, as Fanucci respects Vito's candor and boldness. It also has the advantage of giving Fanucci a false sense of security, making it easier to catch the Don off guard for the assassination. In case there would have been a police investigation, Vito could easily claim (and the people present in the restaurant could be witnesses) that he and Fanucci had a truce and, therefore, had no motive to kill him. Since the murder was committed during the fireworks ceremony and Vito had properly disposed of the gun, there would be no way that he would have been caught."], ["Why does Vito wrap his gun with a towel when he goes after Don Fanucci?", "To act as a primitive suppressor (silencer) and to conceal it so he could take his time and aim, which is why Fanucci asks, \"What have you got there?\" If he had seen a gun in Vito's hand, he likely would have shut the door and run."], ["Roth was dying, so why did Michael need to kill him?", "Honor is the principle of this subject. Roth betrayed Michael and therefore must die by the hand of the Corleone family. If Roth died of natural causes then he would have won/gotten away with it. Michael also seems to doubt that Roth is truly dying: as they plan the hit, he says \"He's been dying of the same heart attack for 20 years.\""], ["What happened during the final Congressional testimony?", "First, the code of \"omerta\". The code originated in Sicily, long invaded and ill-treated by foreign governments, and states that one should never, no matter how they or their families are harmed, go to the authorities. Avenging the harm done was instead in the hands of the offended. Violation of this was considered the ultimate form of disgrace. This belief had much to do with the formation of the mafia and its ultimate growth and staying power. Michael brought Frank Pentangeli's older brother Vincenzo ('Salvatore Po' (qv)) from Sicily. It showed to Frank that his testimony to the Committee would be heard by his brother and family, disgracing him and his family. Thus, he changed his story, refusing not only to implicate Michael, but anyone.\n\nThere are two theories as to why Frank did this. The first is that having Frank's brother show up at the hearing with Michael was a veiled threat that insinuated the brother would be killed as a result of the testimony. Frank assumed his brother would be safe seeing as he was a lonesome shepherd in Sicily with no ties to the mob. Michael was showing him this wouldn't be the case. A second theory is that Vincenzo is a powerful Mafia chieftain in Sicily. Frank tells Hagen afterwards that Vincenzo is \"ten times tougher\" than himself, that he's \"old fashioned\" and that he could have had his own crime family if he moved to America. Vincenzo's icy stare at his brother during the testimony was a threat that Frank's family would be killed if he testified. In an early draft of the script, it was mentioned that Frank had a mistress and child in Sicily under the care of Vincenzo, but he would kill them should Frank testify against Michael. Michael tells Kay afterwards that what happened at the hearing was a personal matter between the brothers."], ["How does the movie end?", "The movie ends in a montage that shows the sequence of events following Mama Corleone's funeral. (1) Roth returns from Israel and is taken into custody by the police. Rocco Lampone ('Tom Rosqui' (qv)) shoots Roth dead. In turn, Rocco is shot dead by the police while trying to escape. (2) Frank Pentangeli is found dead in his bathtub, having slit his wrists. (3) Neri, Fredo, and Anthony are about to go fishing when Michael calls Anthony back, leaving Neri and Fredo to go out alone. As Fredo says a \"Hail Mary\", Neri shoots him in the head when he gets to the part about \"pray for us sinners, now and at the hour of death.\" The final montage has Michael reflecting back to 1941 as the four Corleone children plus Hagen are planning a birthday party for their father. Sonny ('James Caan' (qv)) introduces Connie ('Talia Shire' (qv)) to her future husband Carlo Rizzi ('Gianni Russo' (qv)). Michael announces that, following the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, he has joined the Marines, shocking everyone, especially after the strings Vito had to pull to get him a draft deferment. Vito then arrives and everyone except Michael rushes off to greet him. In the final scene, Michael sits alone in the family garden at Lake Tahoe."], ["What happened to the Rosato Brothers?", "Though the film itself doesn't provide a definitive answer, the video game adaptation posits that a Corleone hit squad (led by the player character) invades the Rosato estate and kills both brothers. Given Michael's low tolerance for treachery, it is highly probable that something along those lines did indeed happen to them."], ["Why does Frank Pentangeli agree to kill himself?", "The reason is mainly to keep his honor, and also to be sure that his family will be taken care of. When he collaborates with the FBI telling them abut the Corleone family, he also reveals his implications, the crimes he had committed for the family. This confession gives him immunity and allows him to avoid doing time. However, he breaks his agreement with the FBI and denies all he had previously said. The alternative to this honourable death offered by Hagen is, then, to be thrown into jail, probably getting killed there. His widow would have to move out of the Corleone house and find someplace to live, while Frankie's kids would be shamed as the sons of a traitor, just like his brother Vincenzo. That's why he accepts. Frankie said it himself that his life wasn't worth a nickel."], ["Why does one of the goons trying to kill Frank Pentangelli in the bar say, \"Michael Corleone says hello\"?", "The whole assassination attempt, including Pentangeli's escape at the end, was planned by Hyman Roth to make Pentangelli believe Michael wanted him dead so that he would turn against him and collaborate with the FBI in the Congressional investigation. Keep in mind that Michael figured out that the attempt on his life at his home was orchestrated by Hyman Roth. But when he talks about this with Roth, he says that he believes it was Pentangelli. Michael then asks Roth if he'd be upset if he had Frankie killed. Roth simply replies with \"He's small potatoes.\" Michael then goes to see Frankie and reveals that he knows it was Roth who betrayed him. Roth either figured this out or planned to make the false attempt on Frankie and use Michael's name before Michael could make the \"actual\" attempt."]], "0045152": [["A Note Regarding Spoilers", "The following FAQ entries may contain spoilers.

While 'Gene Kelly' (qv) was finishing _An American in Paris (1951)_ (qv), he read what Comden and Green had prepared and decided it would be his next film. Kelly and co-director Stanley Donen were at the peak of their powers, and the cast they assembled was perfection (as was Kelly's choreography). The rest of the technical aspects of the film were handled by MGM's extraordinary team of creative artists.

The most logical explanation is that the dog was knocked off the boat and swam to shore. It's possible that, given the young age of the pup, it was not able to swim, but its fate is left to the viewer."], ["Why Did Kurtz Kill Chef?", "The exact reasons for Chef's decapitation are never actually made clear. Chef is last seen on the boat either trying to call for an air strike (for the Army to firebomb Kurtz' compound) OR simply conducting a radio test. One explanation could be that Kurtz knew this and killed him to prevent him from succeeding. Note that later on, just before Willard leaves to kill Kurtz, and at the very end, someone can be heard on the radio trying to contact the boat, implying that the previous conversation had been cut off abruptly, most likely because Chef was attacked and killed either by Kurtz himself or a native following his orders. If this was the case, then Kurtz presumably wanted to make an example of Chef, and dropped his head on Willard's lap as a warning. A second interpretation is that Willard finds Kurtz's notebook in which Kurtz wrote a note for Willard that says \"Drop the bomb, kill them all!\" so he killed Chef because he assumed Willard would tell Chef to order the strike if Willard did not return to the boat in a certain amount of time, which would kill Kurtz, Willard, and everyone else. Kurtz wanted to die honorably, hand to hand by a fellow soldier, but a bombing death wouldn't fulfill that wish. Willard even states that he believes this to be the case. A third interpretation is Kurtz wanted to show Willard the face of the horror. A fourth interpretation is that Kurtz heard about Chef's language towards his people and himself, and was offended by it. After all Lance was spared, likely due to him embracing the insanity."], ["What's the song that plays over the beginning of the film?", "\"The End\" by The Doors.

The second one has no date but the first one does: September 22, 1967. That article, titled \"On the Horizon\" is a real article. When Kurtz reads from it, he gives the title \"War on the Horizon\", but the original title does not have the word \"war\" in it. Without a date attached to it, the validity of the second article can't be confirmed."], ["Why does Willard object to the search of the sampan?", "Willard's mission had priority over any other operations the crew of the PBR might have. The mission was to get Willard close to Kurtz' compound and drop him off\u2014though, because of the top secret nature of it, Willard didn't tell Chief Phillips what the parameters were. When Phillips spotted the sampan and stopped it for an inspection, it was a routine action. However, Willard, having been on many secret missions before, objected thinking that it would cause him and the crew trouble, which it did."], ["Why does Willard so coldly shoot the girl on the sampan?", "There are three possible interpretations, and certainly many more:\n\n1. She was dying and Willard shot her knowing they'd never get her to a medical facility in time.\n\n2. If it was possible for her to live, there are likely not enough provisions (food, water) on the boat for anyone else in addition to the crew. Another movie where this theme is addressed is _Das Boot_ (qv). In that film, after firing torpedoes at a British cargo ship, the U-boat captain leaves the survivors of the British ship in the water even after hearing their cries for help. He knows that a U-Boat simply cannot accommodate prisoners.\n\n3. (Most probable) Willard's mission had priority over everything else and he'd warned the Chief of that before they inspected the sampan (\"You wouldn't even be in this part of the river if it weren't for me\"). Through much of the film, Willard and the Chief lock horns over Willard's mission vs the duty of the boat crew, which is a minor theme of the story. Willard's mission does indeed have priority, but the Chief still feels his duty is to the duties set forth by his own superiors, which include patrolling the river for any enemy forces or those suspected of assisting them. Phillips does say very quickly when they see the sampan that boats like these have been supplying the enemy. Willard staunchly disagrees but the Chief still goes ahead with the inspection.\n\nAdditionally, like Willard says in his voice-over shortly after the sampan incident, \"Those boys were never gonna look at me the same way again.\" It's likely that Willard wanted just that; to make the crew and the Chief realize that Willard is not simply one of them, but a man charged with a top secret mission. To do the job, he has to be a cold-blooded killer and felt the crew needed to know it."]], "0116231": null, "2488496": [["A Note Regarding Spoilers", "The following FAQ entries may contain spoilers.

It is therefore much larger and far more deadly than even the Death Star was. The Starkiller Base was named after 'George Lucas' (qv)'s original last name for Luke Skywalker (who was called Luke Starkiller in early drafts of the original Star Wars). The base is so called because it is powered by draining energy from a sun.

All stories previously published in novels, graphic novels, comics books, encyclopedias and other materials that tell what happened after the events of Episode VI, Return of the Jedi, are now referred to by Lucasfilm as \"Star Wars Legends.\" As to what has not been retconned or otherwise is not different, the protagonists (or particularly Luke, Leia, Han, R2-D2 and C-3PO) of the original trilogy lived on, surviving for thirty years, in which time, Han and Leia were married and had a son who at some point adopted the ways of the dark side of the Force, taking on the archetype of the sorcerer in black who wields a red lightsaber. In The Force Awakens, it is only established that Han and Leia had one offspring; whereas in the old Expanded Universe, they had opposite-sex twins as well as a second son later on, the daughter being the last surviving offspring by the time of three decades after the events of Return of the Jedi.

Zeroes), and FN-2003 (a.k.a. Slip). During his training, he gains the attention of Captain Phasma, due to his exemplary skills at leading his squad, marksmanship, melee and hand-to-hand fighting, combat tactics, and unit cohesion. He is said to be an elite Stormtrooper, with the potential to become an officer. Though Phasma starts to become suspicious of FN-2187, because he shows traits of empathy for Slip (the weak link in the unit). Finn also always felt like an outsider, questioning his role and the motives of the First Order. Even fellow Stormtroopers and his own unit recognize him as being different. The film starts with FN-2187 being sent into his first battle, then having one of his squad (Slip) killed immediately. Realizing he can't kill innocent civilians in cold blood, never fires his weapon.

She is compassionate, respecting life, even that of a droid. She is a skilled fighter, pilot and mechanic. Mid-way through the film, it is revealed that she is incredibly powerful in the Force, even with (according to another character) no training. There are several fan theories about her parentage. The leading theories are that she is: (1) Luke Skywalker's daughter; (2) Obi-Wan Kenobi's granddaughter or perhaps his niece; (3) both a Skywalker and a Kenobi; (4) daughter of Han Solo and Leia Organa, that perhaps Han didn't know about if he left Leia shortly after the conception; (5) a reincarnation of Anakin Skywalker or perhaps even another uniquely immaculately conceived individual, implying messiah; (6) a descendant of Palpatine; (7) somebody who was a Padawan in training, however had her memory wiped for her own safety; (8) an experimental genetically-engineered being, derived from cells in Luke's severed hand; or (9) none of the above and simply an individual with whom the Force is strong 'J.J. Abrams' (qv) said in an interview that \"Rey's parents are not in The Force Awakens\". Which can all but rule out Han, Leia and Luke. However, Abrams may have been speaking in the plural sense, which may not completely rule out the possibility of one of her parents appearing in this film. Also, Abrams has been known to mislead fans in interviews in the hopes of surprising them when the project is released. So Rey's parents could still potentially be anybody."], ["How did Rey know how to fly if she never left Jakku?", "In the novel Before The Awakening, it explains that Rey scavenged a flight simulator from the wreckage of a starship. Every night, Rey would practice flying the different ships available through different scenarios. Putting hundreds, if not thousands of hours into the simulator. Later on in the novel, after a sandstorm, Rey uncovers a near-intact hyperspace freighter. She spends several months repairing it, with the intention of selling it to Unkar Plutt. Eventually, she fixes it up completely and spends some time flying it around in the atmosphere. While her time flying an actual ship was limited, she at least had some experience.

The novel Before The Awakening chronicles Finn's training as a First Order Stormtrooper, and Nines was part of Finn's unit before Finn deserted the First Order, which is why they recognized each other.

The lightsaber is based on an ancient lightsaber design, however the weapon itself is a fairly new construct by Kylo Ren himself (Sith Lords, like the Jedi, build their own lightsaber as part of their training). The cross-guards are actually vents to help disperse the immense power of the unstable main blade.

(2) Takodana is a planet covered in forests and lakes. It is home to Maz Kanata, who resides in a castle that also serves as a watering hole to smugglers, pirates and spies to the Resistance and First Order alike. (3) Starkiller Base is a planet that has been converted into a new superweapon by the First Order. Using the power of the sun, the weapon is capable of destroying entire solar systems. It has forests but is also covered in snow. It's unclear if the planet has constant winter, like Hoth, or if it was caused by the First Order's depleting of the sun. (4) Hosnian Prime is the new home of the reformed Galactic Senate. (5) D'Qar is the home of the new Resistance base and is located in the Outer Rim.

After the new Jedi Order was destroyed by the Knights Of Ren, Tekka retired to the planet Jakku, where he discovered part of the map that lead to Luke Skywalker's location. Fans' theories suggest that he stayed on Jakku to keep watch over Rey, like Obi-Wan did for Luke. The canon Marvel comic book series Poe Dameron is set before the film and features Poe going around to different worlds on his hunt for Tekka, with the First Order also trying to find him first."], ["Who is Snoke?", "Snoke is the Supreme Leader of the First Order. He is also a Force user, who has trained Kylo Ren in the ways of the dark side of the Force. Little else is known about Snoke, though his holographic appearance suggests he is quite old with desiccated, severely scarred flesh. There are countless theories on whom Snoke may be, such as: (1) He is actually Darth Plagueis, Emperor Palpatine's Sith master, notable for his ability to keep people from dying. Plagueis, letting Palpatine believe he killed him in his sleep, retreated to the far reaches of the galaxy, biding his time until Palpatine fell. (2) He was formerly a secret apprentice of Palpatine or perhaps an Imperial Inquisitor. Acolytes trained in the dark side, but not considered Sith lords. (3) He is Ezra Bridger [From Star Wars: Rebels]. (4) He is Gallius Rax from the Star Wars: Aftermath trilogy of books. [spoiler]At the end of the third book, Empire's End, Rax is shot repeatedly and winds up dying. While this could explain Snoke's facial wounds, Rax is never shot in the face.

Growing up, Ben Solo was showing that he was force sensitive and also showing anger and despair. \"Too much Vader in him.\" as Han says. So Leia sent Ben to train with Luke. At some point, Ben learns that Darth Vader is his grandfather. Possibly Snoke revealed this to him. If Luke and Leia kept their parentage a secret, they wouldn't have told the story about how Vader redeemed himself and embraced the light side by saving Luke and casting Emperor Palpatine into the reactor. It was simply assumed that Vader and the Emperor died when the Death Star was destroyed. Once Ben turned to the dark side and became Kylo Ren, he decided to take up his grandfather's legacy, which was to hunt down and destroy the Jedi in the name of the dark side. As far as Kylo knows, this is what Vader started and intends to finish."], ["Why do Kylo Ren's powers seem inconsistent at the end?", "There a few factors that likely lead to Kylo Ren being weaker by the end of the film.\n\n1. He is shot in the side by Chewbacca's bowcaster and was bleeding. Several times throughout the film, Chewie's weapon is shown to be extremely powerful, sending enemies flying in the air and taking out multiple targets with one hit. Kylo isn't sent flying back. In fact, he absorbs the impact and falls to one knee. He is likely using a lot of his concentration and Force powers to remain upright and conscious after taking the hit.\n\n2. Kylo had just [spoiler]killed his own father[/spoiler]. We have seen throughout the film, that Kylo is conflicted, torn between his family, his past and with the dark side of the Force. While he decided to fully pledge himself to the dark side by [spoiler]committing patricide[/spoiler], it is very likely still weighing heavy on his mind, distracting him.\n\n3. It has been established that both Rey and Finn are skilled at hand-to-hand combat. Rey is seen early in the film, taking on two attackers single-handedly, a set of skills she likely learned growing up in solitude on the harsh scavenging planet, Jakku. Finn was raised from birth to become a First Order stormtrooper, and he has been trained in blasters and melee combat accordingly. Finn is also praised by Captain Phasma to have received high marks in combat training and was considered officer material.\n\n4. Snoke mentions that Kylo's training has yet to be completed, therefore, while skilled, Kylo is not yet a master."], ["Why does R2-D2 randomly power up?", "It's interesting to note, when the heroes first arrive at the Resistance base, BB-8 approaches R2 and tries to get him to wake up. C-3PO says that R2 has been in low power mode ever since Luke left. At the end of the film, when the heroes return, R2 powers up, meets BB-8, and together they project the entire map that leads to Luke. Soon after, Rey, Chewie and R2 depart to find Luke. If one looks closely, when the group first goes to the Resistance base, Rey isn't with them, as she was captured by the First Order. At the end, she returns to the base with the rest of the group and that's when R2 powers up. So it's likely he was waiting for her specifically and not the missing piece of the map."], ["Is Finn dead?", "No. Finn is very much alive. He was sliced up the back by Kylo Ren's lightsaber, which caused him to lose consciousness and possibly put him in a coma. But with the futuristic healing techniques in the Star Wars universe, he will likely make a full recovery and be back for more adventures in the sequel, _Episode VIII_ (qv).

While the contents of the package and the identity of the client were never confirmed, it is hinted that Kylo Ren was the client and the remains of Vader's helmet were the package."], ["Why does Luke have a hand made of metal?", "Luke originally lost his hand during his duel with Darth Vader in Episode V, The Empire Strikes Back. At the end of that movie, he received an artificial hand that looked just like his normal one. In Episode VI, Return of the Jedi, Luke was shot in his prosthetic hand. He later covers his hand with a glove, and we can briefly see that the flesh on the hand is damaged (yet the hand apparently still functions normally). However, during Rey's Force vision and later in the final scene of The Force Awakens, Luke clearly has a mechanical hand devoid of flesh. One theory is that Luke never bothered replacing the damaged hand (as a reminder of how close he came to turning to the dark side) and the prosthetic flesh on it eventually deteriorated . Another theory is that Luke lost or damaged his prosthetic hand in a fight occurring after the events of Return of the Jedi but before one of the events shown in Rey's vision in The Force Awakens; in that perhaps Luke was trying to disappear from both the First Order and the Resistance, so he may not have been able to go to a high-level medical facility, out of fear of being recognized and his only option may have been a facility in a less familiar part of space, where he had to settle for any prosthetic he could find."], ["How did Rey learn so quickly what took Luke years to learn?", "Technically, Luke did not take years to learn the ways of the Force either. As the prequel movies showed, a formal Jedi training normally took years, with the apprentice typically entering during early childhood, and finishing after reaching adulthood. However, in Episode _IV_ (qv), A New Hope, Luke is introduced to the Force by Obi-Wan who also gives him a lightsaber. Literally several hours later, Luke already succeeds in deflecting lasers while blindfolded, and he uses the Force to guide his torpedo to its target. When Luke duels with Darth Vader in Episode V, The Empire Strikes Back, he manages himself quite well, even though he only had a reltively short time training with Yoda. A lot of what Luke does seems pretty much self-taught, so apparently, some Jedi apprentices are strong in the Force and adept that they can master the basics much faster than others. It may take additional training by a Jedi Master to reach their full potential, though.\n\nWhile Rey's parentage remains a mystery, it is evident that she's also incredibly powerful in the Force. However, she was able to perform the Jedi mind trick, telekinetically draw an object toward herself, and defeat a powerful Dark Side user, all without any training and barely any knowledge of the Force. It has been suggested that when Kylo Ren reached into Rey's mind to extract the image of the map, he unwittingly allowed her to reach into his mind as well. Therefore, the experience may have given her some knowledge of the Force. It's also possible that Rey already learned these powers, but they were suppressed for a mysterious reason. However, the Force was awakened in her when she took ahold of Luke's lightsaber in Maz Kanata's temple, hence the title of the film. Also, while the Jedi and the Sith were considered extinct, and Rey believed Luke Skywalker to be a myth, the Force was common knowledge, as \"may the Force be with you\" was a common saying. Therefore, it's likely people knew about the abilities to mind-trick and control objects from a distance. So Rey, hearing the stories, decided to make an attempt at it and succeeded.\n\nIt was also established by Obi-Wan in A New Hope, that the Force will partially control your actions, but will also obey your commands. Throughout the series, it is suggested that the Force is a conscious entity that is always looking for balance. It is therefore not unthinkable that the Force favors certain key players in helping them guide their actions.

Before he returns, we see a patient walk back into the room with calming music in the background and Ratched kindly asks him how he is feeling. Three men are also playing cards at a table very intuitively and discussing another doctor as well. This could be a double reverse psychology in which the facility is being run very well, and has been all along before McMurphy even arrived. If so, all of the chaos and disruption was done so by McMurphy who caused an imbalance at the facility.

During the battle of Falkirk, the English, along with the Welsh, send in their entire army to push the Scottish army back. Longshanks ('Patrick McGoohan' (qv)) orders the archers to fire (despite his own troops within range). Morrison is hit twice and presumably dies. Elder Campbell is mortally wounded during the battle but survives for a short period. He dies of his wounds after telling his son, Hamish, that no father could want a better son. Hamish and Stephen survive and are seen at the battle of Bannockburn, charging the English lines and winning their freedom."], ["How does the movie end?", "When Wallace goes to Edinburgh to meet with Robert the Bruce ('Angus Macfadyen' (qv)), who wishes to join with Wallace, he is taken captive by Robert's father and sent to London where the magistrate finds him guilty of high treason and sentences him to be tortured and beheaded. Princess Isabelle ('Sophie Marceau' (qv)), who is in love with Wallace, begs for his life to no avail and tries to slip him something 'to ease the pain,' but Wallace refuses it. The next morning, he is led out of the Tower of London where he is publicly hanged, racked, and disemboweled in an attempt to make him swear allegiance to the King of England. As the crowd begins to yell for mercy, Wallace shouts, 'Freedom!' Just before he is beheaded, he looks out at the crowd and has a vision of Murron. Nine years later, in 1314, Robert the Bruce has been declared King of Scotland. In what is supposed to be his ceremonial acceptance of English rule, he and his troops ride out on the fields of Bannockburn and, instead, attack the English army.

Historically, there is no doubt that it was Edward II, despite his alleged homosexuality. In real life, Princess Isabelle was only nine years old at the time of Wallace's death, and Isabella and Edward II's son (later Edward III) was born in 1312 - seven years after the death of Wallace and five years after the death of Edward I. This is a case of legendary stories conflating historical figures. Edward I did, in fact, take a young French wife after his first wife died. However, Edward II married his young wife, Isabella of France, in 1308 - after his father's death. If there is historical accuracy to the character sent to offer a truce to Wallace, she would have been the King's wife. Edward II succeeded to the throne in 1307."], ["How many horses died in the filming of this movie?", "None, although the scenes of horses being wounded were so real it is said that 'Mel Gibson' (qv) was investigated by an animal welfare organization. The American Humane Film/TV Organization issued the following report describing how fake horses on tracks were used in the various scenes:Horses were used throughout, both as a means of transportation and in the battle scenes. The battle scenes were all shot with pockets of people fighting in different areas, with the horses having their own area. The ground had been dug up and filled with sand for the horse falls. By using a long lens, it pulled the groups of people and animals together for the scenes. Then by adding some cutting and splicing of the film in post production, the scenes appeared very violent with horses in the middle of all the fighting.\n\nIn one scene there were several horses lined up and then charged into a group of warriors. Three of the horses fell head first into the fighters. These were fake horses on tracks. When they got to the end of the tracks they merely somersaulted throwing their stuntriders forward. This was also how a very dramatic scene was accomplished when William is hit by an arrow. He stops fighting, jumps on his horse and rides across the field to attack the King. On his way, the King's protector attacks William and his horse somersaults forward throwing William over his head. The ride across the field was done on a real horse, but the horse that took the fall was, here again, a fake horse on tracks.\n\nIn another scene a horse appears to be stabbed. This was accomplished with a fake retractable knife. Several scenes show horses that appear to be either in or near fire. This was accomplished both by filming through the fire, which made the fire appear closer to the animals than it was, and with special lenses. Fire was both in front of and behind the horses, but never near them. The horses were used to being around fire, but for extra precautions, total fireproof body suits were made for each horse.\n\nIn one scene, William rides his horse into a tower to kill the Earl of Bruce. Then he rides it out of the tower window into the water 30 feet below. The horse ridden into the tower was real, but the horse who rode out of the window falling into the water below was another fake horse on tracks. Other animal action includes a flock of sheep crossing a road, oxen pulling a cart, a flock of birds, farm animals in the background and a deer grazing in the forest.\n\n_Braveheart_ (qv) was filmed entirely on location in Scotland, England and Ireland. American Humane Society was not on the set. They reviewed outtakes of questionable animal action frame by frame, while at the same time, on another screen, viewed frame by frame the actual scenes in the picture.

This is NOT the script of the movie. It's an early draft of the idea which eventually became the movie. It is interesting in its own right. It would have been totally fascinating to see Carrey and Winslet play that script, because they could both pull off aging their characters by fifty years. Not only are the events different, the characters are different. You simply cannot draw valid conclusions about the characters in the movie based on the characters in the first draft, however intriguing both sets of characters and events may be. The shooting draft isn't the final movie either, because things were changed and a lot was left out. Joel is a more likable character in the final movie, and the raw script doesn't indicate how much the director and the actors brought to the final product. Finally, you can read a transcript of the movie here. It's a bit strange because it's just a copy of the English subtitles, so it has no character indications, very few stage directions, etc. Frequently the character speaking changes in the middle of the line, and there's no indication.

We can't see the brand, but anyone who has ever needed it easily recognizes the act."], ["I'm confused about what happens when!", "The complex time line in Eternal Sunshine confuses many people. There are three interacting time lines to consider: real time, dream time, and superimposed time. This is in addition to \"screen time\" -- the amount of time a movie lasts -- which all movies have. It's the interaction of the characters across these different time frames that drives a lot of the fascination with the movie.\n\nReal time: The \"present\" of the movie, specifically February 13-16, 2004. Even this time line has one discontinuity. The movie begins on Feb 14, continues with the night of Feb 15 and morning of Feb 16, then jumps back to the evening of Feb 13 (when the credits begin), follows though that night with the Lacuna people and Clem, briefly repeats the opening and continues beyond the opening.\n\nDream time: Starts when Joel is seen lying on the bed after taking the pill, and goes backward through the history of Joel and Clem's romance.\n\nSuperimposed time: This is the part where first Joel, and then later both Joel and Clem, view the dream event from outside. This is distinct from dream time because their thoughts, conversation, and actions have a forward motion even while dream time is moving backward. You see this first when Joel is first \"under\" and reappears watching himself in the Lacuna office and asks Howard \"am I in my head now\". Then there are scenes with Joel saying to Clem \"there's someone here\" and \"how does he know to call you that\" -- which are linked to the \"real time\" because they result from what Joel is hearing in his bedroom, even while the eraser guys think Joel can't hear them. Clem becomes active in superimposed time after the \"holiday on ice,\" when they first start running from the eraser guys, and eventually becomes more aggressive than Joel in trying to protect his memory (knowing that she has already lost hers and that his memory is the only hope of getting them back together)."], ["If Joel threw his tape out the window, how did he listen to it later?", "The tape that Joel threw out the window of his car isn't the tape from Lacuna. This point probably confuses more people than any other single point in the movie. It's a music tape -- perhaps prerecorded but more likely a mix tape, based on the lack of any visible label. Notice that when Joel ejects the tape, the music (Beck singing Everybody's Gotta Learn Sometime) stops and the console briefly flashes the frequency of a radio station before the cut. According to Kaufman, this is a mix tape which Joel and Clem had enjoyed together and that the song is \"their song.\" (It's been noted that using a cassette tape in 2004 is, like many other things, a retro element of the movie.) At the time Joel tosses the tape, he is on his way home from Lacuna, with the erasure planned for that evening. The movie is running in \"real time\" at this point, but has just jumped backward from the morning of February 16 (when Joel and Clem stop in front of Clem's apartment) to the evening of February 13, just before Joel's erasure. According to Howard's instructions, Joel should have turned this tape in to Lacuna. Probably in his haste, he just forgot. On the way home, he realized that he still had the tape, and either tossed it to avoid encountering it later (per the Lacuna procedure) or just found it too painful to keep. This fits in with the rest of the movie, since Lacuna kept everyone's tapes (as seen with Mary returning them), and at the end of the movie, after the reunion, \"their song\" comes on again over the final credits and plays in its entirety."], ["If it was merely Joel's constructed memory of Clementine that told him to meet her at Montauk after his procedure, then how did the actual Clementine know to meet him there?", "It is there ultimately to show how mysterious the ways of love and relationships are, and to show the limits of science over the human heart. One message of the movie is that time with someone that goes \"sour\" isn't necessarily wasted time (e.g. if you erase all memories that have affected you over the past two years, you also erase the person you have become, and you are liable to make the same mistakes you made before). Not that Joel and Clementine together was a mistake. There is no reason to think that Clementine didn't go through exactly the same denial and attempts to hide a memory of Joel during her erasure. However, while Joel is a more emotional person, he drew far more attention to his actions during his procedure, thus most of the plot of the film, but Clementine may have been a little more resourceful and cunning (just her memory in Joel's mind managed to give Joel enough ideas to throw off the erasers!) and managed to sneak under the radar of the erasers, and hide a memory of Joel. Another possibility is that the beach at Montauk is a special place to them, thus why they are both subconsciously drawn to it. All of Joel's old things that Patrick was using on her could have resonated with her, reawakened things thought to be erased and drawn her back to the beach. Whether due to Patrick's use of the old things or because of an unsuccessful erasure, it is clear that Clementine has some nagging, vestigial memories that she is trying to work out. Most significantly, she keeps going back to the frozen Charles: once with Patrick (which feels wrong to her) and then again with Joel two days later, so it makes sense that she would also return to Montauk. It may be telling that she brings people with her to the frozen Charles because she originally went there with Joel, but goes to Montauk alone as if she has a sense that she is supposed to be meeting someone there."], ["Since dream Clem is just a figment of Joel's imagination, how does she know to meet him in Montauk?", "Some viewers take the literal POV that it's impossible for the \"real\" Clem to be present in Joel's dream and that it's just a dream. Others say that the character in the \"dream\" sequences is really the character of Clem. The character of Clem, as we know her by the end of the movie, is developed more during the dream sequences than anywhere else. That's where Kaufman and Gondry and Winslet put the largest part of their efforts, simply because it's the largest part of the movie. To say this is \"only\" Joel's dream/memory of Clem is to wall oneself off from a lot of Clem's character as portrayed in the movie. If you say that Dream Clem isn't really Clem, then the next question is \"where's the real Clem?\" since her character is mostly developed in the dream. In this POV, there's nothing miraculous about Clem and Joel both going to Montauk. Clem whispered \"meet me in Montauk.\" Howard, just finishing up Joel's erasure, missed this tiny bit -- Joel and Clem had been racing for half the night to protect some memory from the eraser guys, and this was the memory they protected. They then both acted on the memory, though for both it was subconscious. This is a very theatrical view of the movie. In other words, this view says the movie is not supposed to represent events which are possible in the real world, but to tell about characters and about our own emotions and about the human condition. Compare it with Hamlet, that all-time epitome of non-action theater. We don't insist on a realistic explanation for the appearance of the ghost of Hamlet's father. It's just a theatrical convention. Then for almost four hours, nothing happens, and yet many consider it the greatest play ever written. The character of Hamlet is the play. A lot of the difference of opinion on this is a difference between people who are interested in watching movies for the events and people who are interested in watching for the characters. Both are valid ways to watch movies, and some movies cater to one or the other. Clearly Eternal Sunshine draws both kinds of people, hence the ambiguities and the differences of opinion, and also hence a lot of the charm and draw of the film. In any case, Clem in Joel's mind is far more than his memories, as she is saying things and doing things which she clearly never did in real life. This is the \"superimposed time line\" discussed in another entry. Even if you believe that this is \"only\" in Joel's mind, it's more than memory. And it's still Clem's character as we know it through the movie."], ["Where are Montauk, Rockville Centre, and \"the frozen Charles?\"", "The route from Montauk to Rockville Centre to Boston can be seen here. Most of the story takes place in Rockville Centre NY, a town on Long Island about five miles east of Queens (the easternmost borough of New York City). It's just a few miles east of the easternmost road leaving Long Island. Joel's apartment is about 0.4 mile from the LIRR (Long Island Rail Road) Rockville Centre station. Montauk NY is about 100 miles east of Rockville Centre NY, at the eastern tip of Long Island. Montauk Point State Park is at the very tip, and the town of Montauk is adjacent. The train ride would be about two and a half to three hours. The Charles River is in Boston MA. Boston is about 220 miles from Rockville Centre NY, about a 4-1/2 hour drive, perhaps 3-1/2 hours late at night. (It's all on freeways, but the traffic is heavy.) Thus a trip to the Charles River (in Boston) from Rockville Centre is a major drive, about 7 hours round trip, minimum. From Rockville Center NY, the bearings to Boston MA and Montauk NY are only about 30 degrees apart. However, because the only way to cross Long Island Sound east of Rockville Centre is by ferry, Boston and Montauk might as well be in opposite directions from Rockville Centre. The location of the Lacuna office is in lower Manhattan. However, this isn't really significant in the movie. Technically, it's a bit less convenient to reach from Rockville Centre than you'd guess from the movie. It's portrayed as something local, and that's the significant part.\n\nSome people have noted the apparently rural character of the \"frozen Charles\" scenes and the apparent incongruity with the location in central Boston. Nonetheless, there's little ambiguity about the location, because the Charles is a short river, with the source only 26 air miles from the mouth. See here for more information. There are lots of parks along the Charles River even in the urban area. However, the scenes could also imply the outer areas of the Charles, which are closer to Interstates 95 and 495 nearer to the source. The distant headlights in the background would imply this. Also in these areas, the ice would be thicker given the shallower depth; within the immediate Boston area, the ice is generally too thin to safely walk across."], ["What happened at the end of the film? Will Joel and Clementine remain together?", "The original concept of the film involved Joel and Clementine getting together and breaking up many times, indicating that they will be somewhat 'together' forever. This was cut short for time, and they only ended up having one (and a half) relationships.\nThe laughing at the end signifies that the two are happy as they are, and even though there is the distinct possibility that eventually they will get sick of each other and break up, their current feelings towards each other are strong enough for them to continue their relationship no matter what the outcome may be. The viewer in this case gets to decide what the outcome is. However, just before the credits, it can be seen how they are playing in the snowy beach, several times, before the movie fades to white, black, and credits.

The only time we see Clementine with this hair color is at this moment, the day her and Joel first meet.

The only explanation given for their escape is someone overheard saying \"How did they jump out the window anyway?\", implying they were left unsupervised in a place from which they could escape. The most likely answer is that Dudley or someone in his pocket let them go so they could be hunted and killed while resisting arrest, to tie up loose ends. Later, in the records room, after Bud White confronts Exley with Sid's blackmail photo of Exley and Lynn Bracken, Exley deduces this, and experiences a wave of revulsion and guilt with the realization that Dudley set him up to be the negroes' executioner.

However, what Sid does not realize (as does Patchett ultimately) is that Dudley Smith basically sees everyone as disposable.

Recall Sid and Patchett were involved in blackmailing celebrities, as evidenced by Jack Vincennes' statement to Dudley just before Vincennes was killed by the captain.

Reynolds overheard, was spotted and killed, while Loew was allowed to leave alive. Listen closely to Loew's confession as Bud White is dangling Loew out of the office window.

Also, Dudley was dead, and while it would be satisfying to drag his name through the mud and expose him for the psychotic and corrupt individual he was, Exley knew that would severely damage the LAPD's already less than stellar reputation, embarrass Dudley's family (Dudley mentioned he had a wife and daughters) and put a halt on Exley's budding career.

You've likely seen other films where an officer begins with \"You have the right to remain silent...\" and goes on to say that the suspect has the right to an attorney and a phone call. Before Miranda rights were set up to protect BOTH suspects and the police, officers were pretty much allowed to use any tactics they saw fit to get confessions, even false ones. Additionally, police misconduct (brutality) didn't become a major national issue again after Miranda until the Rodney King beating of 1991. There were many incidents of it, but the King incident pushed it to the forefront. So, you have scenes of blatant misconduct like Bud putting his gun in the mouth of one of the black men or Dudley Smith taking known gangsters to the Victory Motel where they were beaten and run out of town."], ["How does the movie differ from the book?", "The movie is essentially a pared-down, cleaner version of the book.\n\nThe action of the book takes place from 1950 until 1958, with the initial heroin theft occurring in 1950, Bloody Christmas in 1951, the Nite Owl Massacre in 1953, and the ultimate revelation of the true motives behind the murders in 1958. In between, each of the main characters become involved in a number of subplots, several of which tie-in to the main action of the story.\n\nMultiple dark, potentially off- putting elements were removed in adapting the book to the screen. Most notably, the Fleur-de-Lis pornography plays a much larger role in the book, and control over its distribution proves to be the ultimate motive behind the Nite Owl massacre. The pornography depicts not only \"arty\" sex scenes but also incest between a prostitute and her son, and most notably, a series of orgies which have been photo doctored so that the participants appear to have been dismembered.\n\nMultiple subplots are also considerably darker than what ended up in the film: one involves a case that Ed's father worked in the 1940s involving a pedophile who kidnapped and murdered children in order to create a winged \"Frankenstein\" child using severed bird wings. Another involves Bud White trying to capture a serial killer who beats prostitutes to death and then engages in necrophiliac sex with their corpses.\n\nIn the novel, Ed and Jack are significantly darker than in the film: Ed Exley was a deserter during WWII, but was never caught because his entire squad died in combat and he claimed to be the sole survivor after being found. His father, Preston, is still alive and is a cop-turned-real estate mogul. It is under Preston's tutelage that Ed becomes a cruel, politically-minded police officer who only solves crimes for glory and because his father taught him the principal of \"Absolute Justice,\" a zero-tolerance approach to law enforcement. There is no \"Rollo Tomasi\" story, and it is Ed's brother who was killed by a purse snatcher. Ed begins dating Inez Soto after the capture of the Night Owl Suspects, and she ultimately goes to work for his father and Raymond Dieterling, a Walt Disney pastiche whose dark past figures heavily in the novel's climax.\n\nJack Vincennes is a recovering drug addict who accidentally murdered a married couple during a stakeout because he was high and mistook them for criminals he was pursuing. Over the course of the book he becomes addicted to the violent pornography he is investigating and finds himself unable to fantasize about sex without it involving multiple women and severed body parts. The only hint of this side of Vincennes' personality might be seen in the scene where he pockets the small bag of marijuana that Matt and Tammy had.\n\nThe climax of the book are a pair of shootouts, one in a deli and one that occurs during a siege on a train transporting prisoners. Jack Vincennes is present for the latter and dies trying to help Ed and Bud prevent prisoners from escaping. The film's climactic shootout at the Victory Motel actually occurs in the book's prologue and ends with the death of Buzz Meeks; Dudley Smith actually survives the book and goes on to be the antagonist of the novel \"_White Jazz_ (qv),\" which ends with Dudley being confined to a nursing home after he is attacked with an axe and rendered mentally retarded."], ["Exley says that the two officers who were beaten by the Mexican men sustained minor injuries.

This is known as the Gunpowder Plot. V is loosely based on Guy Fawkes, and his plot to destroy the parliament building is similar. However, the movie's depiction of Guy Fawkes is not historically accurate, due to a few minor details. For example, the beginning of the film shows Fawkes being hanged until dead, but Fawkes actually leapt from the gallows and broke his neck in order to avoid being hanged, and then drawn and quartered by his executioners."], ["What is the mask V is wearing and what is its significance?", "V wears a Guy Fawkes mask and used his story as a role model in his quest to end the Norsefire rule. This was because V felt Guy Fawkes was right in trying to bring down what he felt was an oppressive government during his day. Similar masks were/are traditionally used for Fawkes effigies on Bonfire Night in the United Kingdom when the effigies are burned. The burning, and accompanying use of fireworks, is the traditional centre-piece of the festivities. Fawkes is the victim in this ritual; it is daring, and initially puzzling, for someone to take the mask on himself, as if saying 'here is the one you have killed' and 'here I am to be killed.' V also briefly explains the significance of the mask when he says: \"This visage, no mere veneer of vanity, is a vestige of the vox populi, now vacant, vanished.\""], ["Is V a superhero with super powers?", "Yes and no. The injections he was given at Larkhill have the result of increased kinesthesia in V...improved reflexes, agility (motor skills), and a reduced sensitivity to pain.\nHowever, if you listen to the coroner's exact words, there is a suggestion of superpowers having developed: \"The mutations seem to have triggered the abnormal development of basic kinesthesia and reflexes.\" It's possible that The Wachowski brothers misunderstood, or decided to expand, the definition of kinesthesia, which is in fact that sense that allows us to determine the physical positions of our extremities in relation to ourselves. For example, it allows us to touch our nose with our eyes closed. In the case of V, we are perhaps expected to believe that he was able to comprehend his position, and the position of other objects, in the physical universe with greater speed and claity than an average human. This, combined with his increased strength, does suggest he was a form of superhero.\n\nIn the graphic novel, no such mention of \"increased abilities\" is made, nor are we given any reason to believe that he acts with any abnormal capability. He is not presented as a 'superhero' in the classic, 'spandex-clad-with-no-visible-means-of-support' sense. In the source material, V is described as 'a psychopath... in its most precise sense.' The experimentation at Larkhill had no physical effect on him, but rather altered his perception of the world and how he occupied it. It essentially removed the subconscious censor that we all have between thought and action. Our minds/bodies work on a sequence of perception-evaluation-planning-conscience-reaction (we see a threat, we take a moment to work out how dangerous it is, then how to counter it, then we have a moment's doubt, and then we defend/attack/run away). V has lost the middle steps of the sequence and as a result, his body reacts instantly and instinctively, doing exactly what he needs to in order to counter any threat without conscience. To 'normal' people, the ability to act without fear of the consequence may seem inhuman...but not Superhuman.\n\nThere are some elements that might be seen as supernatural, although the surface asserts a purely natural narrative; the inexplicable appearance in the swept and secure Victoria Station is one. Sending out hundreds of thousands of tight fitting costumes and tall boots, all of which appear to fit the wearers, might be another. Most of all, the image with the dominoes, intercut with Finch's psychic perception of the pattern, suggests at least a supernatural relationship to causality."], ["What exactly were the Fingermen?", "They are Creedy's special police force. They do the black-bagging and interrogations, as well as having the authority to make on-the-spot judgements for offenders, without due process. Finch is the leader of the Nose, which is essentially the regular police force - they sniff out criminals. Sutler might be considered the Brain. The Fingers do the dirty work. The Eyes and Ears are visual and auditory surveillance. The Mouth is the news outlets, the propoganda machine. Together they make up the Head and the five senses, though only the term \"Fingermen\" survived the novel's translation to film, with the Nose, Mouth, etc left unmentioned by those names."], ["What were the Fingermen trying to do to Evey in the beginning?", "In the film, breaking curfew is a crime for which Fingermen (the secret police) get judicial discretion on dealing with suspects (in effect, acting as judge and jury, meting out punishment themselves). The men Evey runs into in the film were planning to use this discretion to rape her with a legal seal of approval. In the graphic novel, the charge is prostitution and the Fingermen clearly state they are going to rape AND kill Evey."], ["What is The Old Bailey?", "The Old Bailey is the Central Criminal Crown Court in Central London, and yes, it is actually known today as \"The Old Bailey,\" although, officially, \"The Old Bailey\" is the name of the road on which the Court is located."], ["Were V's explosives at Jordan Tower real? If so, how could someone who isn't a bomb expert (Dascombe) defuse them?", "This has not been revealed, but many believe ultimately it doesn't matter, believing that their purpose was never to kill/hurt people. Instead, they were to be a tool to scare/force people at the station to allow V access to the airways, and then later, to keep them busy while he made his escape. However, if they were real, Dascombe's ability to disarm them was due to either: 1) The bomb's set up wasn't so intricate that there was a right and wrong wire to be cut. If any part of the setup was disconnected, the whole thing wouldnt work. 2) He has prior expierence in working with explosives, perhaps as part of military service or employment by the police. 3) He simply got lucky and guessed the correct wire. If they weren't real, then it didn't matter what he did, or did not do, as nothing would have happened either way.\n\nCommon arguments for them being real: 1) Killing well-known news anchors, as well as destroying their main news studio, would have stirred up more emotion amongst the government and populace than the deaths of people they've never heard of, or buildings no one cares about. 2) V knows that as soon as possible after his message is broadcast, the BTN will surely play some sort of message against it, either the disheartening \"terrorist captured and killed\" response we saw, or something similar. By destroying the country's main news studio, as well as its top anchors immediately afterwards, it delays the time the BTN is able to broadcast a response, giving the populace who saw it more time to think it over and inevitably discuss it amongst themselves. The BTN's response will also be less believable due to the delay and in hearing it from lesser or completely unknown anchors. 3) Any single terrorist act, especially subsequent attacks (remember the first attack being the destruction of the Old Bailey) will always cause an erosion, at least temporarily, in popular support for a government.\n\nCommon arguments for them not being real: 1) If they had gone off, V could have been close enough to have been killed/injured in the explosion. 2) An explosive of that size would not have been great enough to cause significant damage to the building and/or BTN's propaganda apparatus. Consider that even if the explosion had destroyed the studio and a good part of the surrounding floor, surely BTN has other studios available, at other locations, which could broadcast whatever they want in a matter of minutes. 3) V displays a tendency to not kill without specific reason. Therefore, it isn't likely that he would blow up a room full of civilians who hadn't harmed him personally. However, a good counterargument to 3) is that V's Domino Plan involves inspiring violent anarchy in the UK. This will result in civilian deaths/casualties as Norsefire will undoubtedly commit even further outrage-inspiring atrocities in an attempt to restore order. Also, V clearly does not have any problem killing Fingermen and police officers who work for the state. As such, office personnel at the BTN could easily be considered among those working for the state, and therefore part of the problem."], ["What does the saying \"Vi Veri Veniversum Vivus Vici\" on the mirror Evey is cleaning mean?", "It is Latin for, \"By the\npower of truth, I, while living, have conquered the universe.\" Although\nV attributes the phrase to Faust both in the graphic novel and the\nmovie, it doesn't occur either in Marlowe's Faustus or Goethe's Faust\nbut in fact was a motto of the 20th century occultist Aleister Crowley."], ["Why was V sent to Larkhill?", "No one knows as it is not stated in either the movie or the graphic novel. Furthermore V says that he lost his memory while at Larkhill, so during the timeframe of the movie's events, even he didn't know why he had been sent there. It's only stated that he was an \"undesirable,\" which could mean that he was not heterosexual, a non-Christian, had possessions that were deemed offensive, that he spoke out against the political regime, or anything else the totalitarian government prohibited. In an interview Hugo Weaving did with IndieLondon, he offered the following...\nYou understand that he's been tortured and physically abused and that's what has created him. But at the same time the reason he was imprisoned in the first place was, I would suggest, because he was some kind of political activist. And I think he was probably an actor so he has very strong opinions.The original graphic novel's Larkhill was based loosely off of Hitler's concentration camps and the Nazi atrocities, and it is left open whether V is a member of a racial minority, is homosexual, or that he was taken for his political views. However, it's possible that he was not being specifically punished, seeing as he was placed in a group that was almost certain to be unceremoniously disposed of. A man who can fashion explosives and destroy a detention facility in which he's being held captive is likely to make authoritarians nervous wherever he goes."], ["What were they doing to the prisoners at Larkhill?", "V and the other prisoners were injected with a virus that was later used at St. Mary's, Three Waters (water treatment plant), and a London tube station. More specifically, the Larkhill prisoners were the \"lab rats\" in Norsefire's experiments while the party was attempting to develop a super-bioweapon. There is an implication that the St. Mary's virus came from the blood of V himself, since he was the trial which gave the coroner hope and since he was the only subject who survived the Larkhill explosion. This would provide another reason for his vendetta against the government, since he felt partially responsible for the virus. This is seemingly contradicted by the diary of Delia Surridge, who claims that all her work was destroyed in the explosion at Larkhill; however, she might have been writing that as merely an assumption, as she afterwards distanced herself from the project and might well not have known if any data had survived. During the 'flashback' scene it was rather definitively implied that everybody who was injected died... except for V. Thus, we may assume that for whatever reason he is unique, or at the very least an extremely rare specimen in some biological or physiological sense, and that most people would not develop as he did... or else Larkhill would have been overrun by V-type super-people. The movie does seem to imply V is given some sort of superhuman ability by the experimentation at Larkhill, as Delia's diary says: \"the mutations seem to have triggered the abnormal development of basic kinesthesia and reflexes.\" Those responsible for Three Waters and St. Mary's also came out with a miracle vaccine for the virus that made them very wealthy and allowed them to be saviors in a time of fear and utter chaos. It would stand to reason that this vaccine would be developed from V's blood, as he was the only one able to resist the virus. V's role in the viral attacks would then be as the originator of the vaccine. This would explain how V knew of the history of the virus and vaccine that he relates to Finch and Dominic. The graphic novel merely implies that the prisoners were experimented on with no real purpose, like the Nazis with Jews in WWII. The super-soldier story line is the Wachowskis take on the purpose of the experimentation."], ["What caused the explosion at Larkhill?", "This is explained in an expanded voiceover of Delia Surridge's (the coroner that V killed) journal, which exists in the original script but was cut much shorter for the final product. While at Larkhill, V was allowed to tend the garden there, for which he had access to chemical supplies, grease solvents, ammonia, and fertilizer. He used those to produce napalm and mustard gas."], ["In the doctor's diary, she mentions that the man from room 5 has no eyes. Is V blind?", "There are two theories: (1) The doctor is talking metaphorically, i.e. she couldn't see his eyes because of the fire but knew he was looking at her. Throughout the movie, V can be seen reading books, watching movies, and visually noticing people. (2) Yes, he is blind. You can clearly see his face around his eyes is caved in and completely black on the close up, with no flames distorting your view, and it can be assumed that his enhanced kinesthesia is the way he views the world now, with no need for visual perception. This would, of course, necessitate an expanded definition of the the meaning of the term 'kinesthesia.\"\nIn the comic book, however, it mentions (In the Doctor's Diary), that he has eyes, and is not blind. Quote 'He looked at me today as if I were some sort of insect. He looked at me as if he felt sorry for me.'. This is the part where the Doctor is beginning to go into more detail about him. Also, when V explodes the facility, the Doctor again mentions him looking at her, and it describes the gaze, so you would assume he has eyes, and is not blind."], ["What's with the Scarlet Carsons and how did the coroner connect them to V?", "This is explained in an expanded voiceover of the coroner's diary that exists in the original script but was cut shorter for the final product. In it, she explains that V was allowed to tend the garden at Larkhill, where he \"grows roses. Beautiful roses.\" Therefore, she knew it was V when she saw the rose Finch handed to her. The scarlet carsons were grown by the lesbian lover of Valerie, the actress in The Salt Flats, who wrote the autobiography on toilet paper that she passed to V during their incarceration. That autobiography inspired V to live without fear, and he used those flowers as a signature for the killings he committed as retribution for Larkhill. The flowers in the movie are Scarlet Carsons, but the graphic novel claims them to be Violet Carsons, another connection to the letter 'V'. Violet Carson (1898 - 1983) was a British actress most famous for playing the role of Ena Sharples in the soap opera 'Coronation Street'. There really is a Violet Carson rose created in 1963/64 and named after the actress."], ["Who's shaving Evey's head? The hands of the person doing it aren't all scarred like V's.", "It's hard to tell through the latex gloves whether or not the hands are scarred, but it is supposed to be V shaving her head; he just used makeup to disguise his hands. In reality, however, since they would only be able to shave Portman's head once, they had to get the shot in one take; therefore, they had one of the hair dressers do it. The person actually shaving Evey's head is Jeremy Woodhead (hair designer/stylist) for the film."], ["Did V have help during Evey's torture?", "No, V is a master of disguise and he's able to disguise his voice as well. In some shots the \"interrogator\" moves briefly into the light and you can actually see that it is Hugo Weaving.

Weijers Domino Productions proposed and designed the pattern including the falling sequences as well as the coloring effects. It took 4 professional domino assemblers 200 hours to set up 22,000 tiles. Each tile is 1 7/8\" tall by 7/8\" wide and 1/4\" thick.

In the mirror on the wall is the reflection of a man. Who is it?", "The man visible in the mirror is Inspector Finch."], ["Why is the little girl with the glasses there at the end, along with Evey's parents, Gordon, and the two lesbian women? Aren't they dead?", "This is the most controversial point in the interpretation of the movie, and the comments below show very different points of view. It contains the secret of the question, \"Who is he?\", and you will get very different answers depending on whether you take it for a return of the dead or an image for the film audience of the many people who make up V that is not 'real' in Evey's and Finch's reality - they could not walk out and meet Valerie etc. The plain reading is that they were dead before but alive and real at the end. They are those he promised to Vindicate in the V-monologue and the Vigilant, that is, those who wait at midnight. In this reading, the death of V has raised the dead; consistent with a good deal of messianic images and the Paschal tone of the final scene. If so, it's grounded in a gnostic or Arian Christology. The 'new world' is not shown, but is more than a political change. Alternatively, they aren't there physically and it's not a film blooper. They're there in spirit, carried in the hearts and minds of those who really do stand there. It's also notable that this is the only scene in the film (apart from the flashbacks) where any black people are seen. The graphic novel was more explicit about the fact that the Norsefire party had performed extensive racial cleansing in England, whereas the film merely hinted at it, focusing more on the persecution of homosexuals.\n\nThis is a physical representation of one of V's guiding principles: that you can't kill an idea; each of them represents part of the idea of freedom and self-expression. An idea, literally, is a form or archetype - so this is physically shown in the people's being antitypes of V. The obvious symbolism here, coupled with that present from the beginning of the movie with regards to a Guy Fawkes comparison and the constant mention of 'ideas' suggests that it was an intentionally symbolic scene. This 'idea' being the most important element of the movie, it makes sense that it would be steadily expanded upon and culminate in its most visceral representation during the movie's climactic final scene. V leads into it himself, during Creedy's death, by suggesting that he is still alive due to the fact that he is not just a man: \"beneath this mask there is more than just flesh... beneath this mask, there is an idea,\" despite the fact that we have alternative and deliberately presented reasons as to why he is alive, if only briefly. With the explosion of the Parliament building, the 'idea' culminates in the visual depiction of various individuals who fought for this idea... people we know to already be dead. The people are still dead, but the idea is alive, the idea has triumphed. This scene can also be interpreted to illustrate what Evey said to Inspector Finch at the finale: \"He (V) was Edmond Dant\u00e9s (the hero of \"The Count of Monte Cristo\")... and he was my father. And my mother... my brother... my friend. He was you... and me. He was all of us, \" meaning that V did it all for them (Gordon, the little girl with glasses, Evey's parents, etc.). In this sense, V symbolized the victims, both living and dead, of the government's atrocities, especially those who had questioned or fought against the oppression of the government.\n\nThe most literal explanation would be that none of them actually did die; we never see any of these characters die on-screen. Gordon is black-bagged, the girl is only shot once, and the two lesbians are killed/black-bagged in a possibly subjective flashback. However, this explanation stretches plausibility for a number of reasons: While we never see Gordon die, he is arrested and beaten, and it seems highly unlikely he would have simply been released, in light of his collection of forbidden items as well as his mockery of Sutler. We do see Valerie's body in a mass grave in an earlier flashback, one not based on the contents of her letter, and she and Ruth appear in the crowd without having aged at all in the twenty years since their arrest. Finally, we would also have to believe that the parents of a child suffering a gunshot wound to the chest would take her out of the hospital and involve her in a potentially violent conflict with armed soldiers. Moreover, judging by the view on the little girl's body right after she is shot (immobility, non-living eyes), it's very fair to assume she is dead. While the girl did not die (and was not shot) in the graphic novel, Ruth, Valerie, and Gordon definitely did.\n\nThis is a theme along the lines of, \"an idea never dies.\" For instance, from Evey's first lines: \"...We are told to remember the idea, not the man, because a man can fail. He can be caught, he can be killed and forgotten, but 400 years later, an idea can still change the world. I've witnessed first hand the power of ideas, I've seen people kill in the name of them, and die defending them... but you cannot kiss an idea, cannot touch it, or hold it... ideas do not bleed, they do not feel pain, they do not love... And it is not an idea that I miss, it is a man... A man that made me remember the Fifth of November. A man that I will never forget. \" And then the scene with Creedy emptying his pistol trying to kill V : \"Beneath this mask there is more than flesh. Beneath this mask there is an idea, Mr. Creedy, and ideas are bulletproof.\" By showing the people that have been slain, it shows that their idea, THE idea, lives on."], ["What is the music that plays during the destruction of The Old Bailey and Parliament?", "It's the finale of the 1812 Overture by Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky.

To the government in the movie and under current legal definitions in the US and UK, he is a terrorist. To the people of London in the film, to Evey and Finch by the end of the film, he was a freedom fighter. It's possible that he was both; for instance, the Sons of Liberty in the American Revolution were a terrorist group fighting for American freedom.\nHowever, Alan Moore, who wrote the graphic novel, would disagree with both of these. One of Alan Moore's problems with the film was that it painted 'V' as a freedom fighter when he is in fact an anarchist. Anarchy is far more important to V's character than terrorism or freedom, but it is hardly even addressed in the film.

However, just because a work is similar in subject does not mean it is plagiarized or a \"rip-off.\" 1984 was itself largely influenced by Yevgeny Zamyatin's We and, to a lesser extent, Jack London's The Iron Heel, and all dystopian novels ultimately stem from such classics as Thomas More's Utopia and Plato's Republic, which depict \"ideal\" societies that many people today would find oppressive. 1984 was also largely influenced by world events occurring at the time it was written (1948), and this is clearly true for V as well. Fundamentally the stories are actually quite dissimilar, as _V for Vendetta_ (qv) tells the tale of a revolution planned, announced, anticipated and then carried out. In 1984, there is no revolution. The rulers are never threatened and the status quo remains constant. There is a brief moment of recognition that a revolution would be beneficial for the masses, but before that thought is given a chance to grow it is swiftly snuffed out by a brutal and torturous form of systematic mind reconditioning."], ["Is this movie just liberal propaganda to disparage George W. Bush?", "Not a direct attack, no. Art, as a medium, is often too subtle for such methods. It tends to run to the sort of scathing sarcasm and derision that undermines its target rather than attempting to assault them directly. On the other hand, the fact that you have asked the question demonstrates not only that the designed purpose of the film and its story is to enlighten the viewer while exposing cheap political demagoguery and social elitism for what they truly are, but that it succeeded in achieving that goal as well by actually stimulating the thinking processes which is ultimately the true goal of all art. The original comic book was written by a Briton named Alan Moore and illustrated mostly by David Lloyd, starting in 1982 and published through 1988. It was aimed directly at Margaret Thatcher and Fascism. Alan Moore took umbrage with the film adaptation, making comments to the effect that the filmmakers did not have the courage to make an out-and-out attack on Bush, so they decided to adapt the story he'd written for their own purposes. In one scene, a protestor is carrying a sign which appears to have the word \"BUSH\" written on it. Plus, if you're aware of the 'Doc Frankenstein' comic series the Wachowskis created, they seem very liberal, so the question isn't that far-fetched. Nevertheless, it does bear remembering that the script for this film was in development as far back as the mid-nineties, well before Bush took office. The visual imagery of the Norsefire party, with its red and black flags that used an old, largely outmoded religious symbol as it chief device and the scenes of Sutler campaigning with fervent shouting and gesticulating seem clearly designed to evoke recollections of the Nazi regime rather than any modern political situation. The slight alteration of the Leader's name from the novel (originally Adam Susan rather than Sutler) also seems to be a deliberate attempt to reference Hitler. The party's practice of marginalizing and shipping ethnic and social minorities to detention camps is also a clear reference to the Third Reich, rather than modern America. Of course, certain details from modern times were included to make the story more identifiable to a modern audience, such as Prothero's similarity to various media pundits with staunch conservative viewpoints, as well as the brief reference to an avian flu outbreak and the general notion that the media exists to distract and worry the public rather than inform them of the facts. The Nazi references in this movie were far more obvious and deliberate than any disparagement of George Bush."], ["How do you make the egg and toast thing V made and what is it called?", "This dish goes by various names, but the one used in the movie is called \"Egg in a Basket,\" or, as Gordon calls it \"Eggy in a Basket\" (Alan Moore especially disliked this detail, finding it unauthentic). Butter both sides of a piece of thick bread. Cut a hole in the middle, using a cookie cutter or glass. Drop a small bit of butter into a skillet or frying pan on low heat. Place the bread into the pan. Give it a few moments, and put 1 egg into the middle of the hole. When the egg begins to set, flip the whole thing over. Keep flipping until the egg is done the way you want. Keep the heat on low and don't get impatient; you'll have ashes on charcoal if you put the heat up too high. If you make more than one, put more butter in the pan each time. As a slight variation, you can put a slice of your favorite cheese and/or a deli thin slice of ham about a minute before it's done cooking. Do not flip once you've put the cheese on. This is also known as One Eyed Toast or an Egg in a Frame (in the southern parts of America). A similar dish using Italian bread and peppers is made in _Moonstruck_ (qv).

Are they related or something?", "No, V is not related to Gordon nor do they ever meet in the film. The similarities are there to illustrate that the two men are similar in their respective situations: V was sent away to a detention camp, Gordon would likely be similarly sent away if his identity as a gay man were publicly known. Both are forced to hide their \"true faces\" in order to survive. It's also likely that, in the earlier scenes of this nature, that Gordon is being set up as a red herring for a possible secret identity for V, though the film points out rather quickly that this is indeed not the case. Additionally, V is unusually tall and thin; Gordon could not possibly fit into that costume, and, having seen the DVD image, he must know it himself, and know that Evey can see this as well. The similarities drawn between various people in this film--which have led to multiple questions along the vein of 'Is this person also THIS person?'--are intentionally designed to demonstrate that everyone is human. Everyone is 'the same' in that they are deserving of freedom, justice, and the chance to live. This would be meant to stand against the Norsefire government's message of minorities, sexual \"deviants\" and others being a threat due to their perceived differences from the majority. In the book, V is referred to as an idea/concept, and this could be applied to other characters in the book; no matter how 'normal' you try to make people, their individualism will always show through. Gordon had a secret room and was homosexual, the man in charge of 'The Head' was in love with the computer that fed him information, and it is implied (towards the end) that he masturbates over it, which could also be deemed non-'normal' behaviour."], ["What are the photos on the wall in Gordon's secret room?", "They are homoerotic pictures of muscle-men in intimate moments.

This may be a subtle reference to the infamous \"blood flag\" of Nazi Germany, which had a similar color scheme and also used a cross variant, the fylfot, as its chief device, now known almost exclusively as the swastika. The cross could also be seen as a St George's Cross (representing England) and a Nordic cross (representing the \"Aryan\" race) placed together. In the graphic novel, the posters (which originally read \"Strength through purity, purity through faith) used the traditional Christian cross.

In the screenplay, there is an omitted piece of dialogue wherein Rookwood indicates that he recorded the conversation when Creedy came to him with the assignment of taking the virus to St. Mary's. This line was dropped from the finished film, but the subsequent mention of the recording inexplicably remained.

If a bullet is shot at that close range, such as we see in the film, it can probably pierce through, especially if it's already filled with holes from other bullets. Body armour also only tends to protect against penetration by diffusing the impact across a larger surface area. Getting shot with body armour is comparable to getting hit at the same speed with a baseball instead of a bullet, which can cause internal bruising and bleeding, and after enough hits, just the impact alone can be fatal. You also see him getting shot in the hands, arms, shoulders and back, any of which could also harm him, as these hits coupled with his extensive movement immediately afterwards as he fights would cause an extraordinary amount of blood loss. The armour visually quotes the angels' armour in \"Wings of Desire\" - cited in \"V4V from Script to Film\" - and symbolically, when he removes it he puts off something transcendent, just after the Matrix-y shivering of the background that intimates a shift of realities, descending to ordinary mortality.

The two share a tender moment and V tells Evey that it is up to her to decide if the train filled with bombs should blow up Parliament, as his exile has made him no longer part of the people. He dies in her arms. Evey places V's body inside the train and is interrupted by Finch. She refuses his orders to stand down, and convinces him of the country's need for hope. Finch lowers his gun, Evey pulls the switch and the train goes off. A mass of people approach in silence, orderly but not in marching order, outside in V's mask and cape, overtaking the guards.

He wrote:\nLegend has it that Hitchcock was furious when 'Vera Miles' (qv) became pregnant and dropped out of _Vertigo_ (qv). Perhaps a more realistic assessment, though, is that [Alfred] Hitchcock and [James] Stewart had been having their own doubts about Miles as a star.\n\nHitchcock had discovered 'Vera Miles' (qv) during casting for his television series, and he was impressed enough to place her under personal contract; yet according to ['Samuel A. Taylor' (qv)], though secure about her acting ability, Hitchcock felt she didn't yet possess that luminous quality that made a star. By placing her under exclusive contract, he hoped to create that quality in her.\n\nFrom the onset, though, Miles was reluctant to be shaped by anyone--even a director she respected as much as Hitchcock. Her first feature with Hitchcock was not exactly a showcase for the new blonde. _The Wrong Man_ (qv)'s microscopic focus on the justice process left little screen time for Manny's wife. Dressed down and psychologically shattered by Manny's unjustified arrest, Miles's character is never fully developed. Hitchcock seemed impatient with the wife's story line, and his indifference shows on screen. The film's sanitarium scenes are similar to the scenes in _Vertigo_ (qv), with the same overwhelming sense of helplessness in the face of psychological crisis; yet there was little occasion for 'Vera Miles' (qv) to do much else on-screen to make an impact.\n\nThis film, and the role in _Vertigo_ (qv) that was intended to follow, dominate the 'Vera Miles' (qv) story. There is much more, though, to the full picture. Her career had begun with small roles in 1951 in _Two Tickets to Broadway_ (qv) and in 1952 in _For Men Only_ (qv); Miles effectively used her television performances as audition pieces for Hitchcock--and for 'John Ford' (qv), who cast her in _The Searchers_ (qv) a year before she filmed _The Wrong Man_ (qv). _Vertigo_ (qv) was intended as Miles's big break--but even before her first screen tests in November of 1956, there were signs of doubt from Hitchcock. A few weeks before Miles reported to Stage 5 at Paramount for hair, costume, and makeup tests, Hitchcock screened _The Eddy Duchin Story_ (qv), a biopic featuring an actress ['Kim Novak' (qv)] who was being molded by one of Hitchcock's crosstown rivals ['Harry Cohn' (qv)].\n\n\u2014 Auiler, '_Vertigo_ (qv)': The Making of a Hitchcock Classic, NY, 1998, pp. 20, 21."]], "0032551": [["A Note Regarding Spoilers", "The following FAQ entries may contain spoilers.

Example: During a bank robbery, you would have 30 witnesses, all with different versions of the events and all with different descriptions of the robbers. In the armored car robbery, Waingro pistol-whips the first guard in a moment of adrenaline, since the guard is not stepping back when Waingro orders him to do so (for two reasons, one being that they are deafened, and the second being that since Waingro has a hockey mask on, they can't tell who is addressing them). As soon as the guard is pistol-whipped, Cheritto turns to him and tells him, \"Hey Slick, see that shit [blood] comin' outta their ears? They can't fuckin' hear you!

The officers behind the police car roadblock most likely do survive. There is a black-skinned officer with a shotgun who gets shot by Neil, but is then seen pulling another wounded officer behind a police car for safety. The only officer who definitely was killed was Bosko, and he probably was the only police casualty resulting from the shootout, since his pictures is the only one displayed on the news, and the other officers were either just severely wounded or had bullets stopped by body armor."], ["What did Vincent mean when he said to the Captain at the precious metals repository \"I have tactical command that supersedes your rank!\" and let Neil and ultimately let the robbers go?", "Vincent is a lieutenant. Normally he would be out ranked by the SWAT team leader, who is a captain. However, because the case is Vincent's, he has ultimate authority over how to proceed, including in the use of the Captain's SWAT team. Their specific disagreement was over whether to arrest Neil and his crew. The Captain wanted to arrest them right away. However, since they had not actually taken anything, Vincent knew that all they could arrest them for was a minor breaking and entering charge. Vincent wanted to put the crew away for an extended sentence, preferably for the murders of the armored car guards (which would likely earn them life sentences). Arresting them now would have interfered with that and allowed Neil and his crew to go back to robbery after a a few months in custody."], ["Why would Neil be so concerned about Chris' domestic problems? Why does he confront Charlene in the hotel?", "There's two possible motives for Neil. One is that Neil needs Chris to be focused on their work. Chris Shiherlis also has a pretty big gambling problem; when he's talking to Charlene at their house he tells her that he'd \"squared things with the bookies\". At the truck stop, Neil says that everyone's split from the armored car robbery (which he'd gotten from Nate) was in his car. Shiherlis had likely taken his split & paid off his bookies, the people who laid his most recent bets. When he got home, Charlene was angry that the money Chris had brought home wasn't the amount she was expecting, and it leads to a fight between them.\n\nWhen Neil talks to Shiherlis in the apartment, he asks Shiherlis where all the money from their recent jobs has been going. Chris mutters about Vegas & the Super Bowl which probably means he'd lost a large amount of cash in Las Vegas and had bet another large amount on the big game. So he decided to take most of the money he'd earned on robbery jobs and pay off his bookies. Neil was concerned because if Shiherlis's head isn't in the jobs they're doing, which require very precise work to be done, that one or all of those jobs would fail because of Shiherlis making a slip-up that gives the police information to track them. So he talks to Charlene, very harshly, about her affair with Alan Marciano and about giving Chris a 2nd chance. She agrees, especially since Neil promises to take care of herself and their son if Shiherlis screws up again, and Charlene wants to leave him.\n\nThe other possible motive is much simpler: that Neil and Chris (and the rest of the team) really are friends. After Cherrito dies in the shootout and Neil talks about it with Eady he tries to talk tough and to act like he doesn't care about it but he still refers to Cherrito as his friend and seems to be trying to convince himself as much as Eady. He goes through a lot of trouble to keep Chris' marriage together and to watch out for him. When Chris is shot during the shootout Neil risks his life to save him and then continues to put himself in danger by getting him to a doctor. He also tries to meet up with Chris later at Nate's and doesn't seem very happy that Nate let Chris go off on his own."], ["If Breedan was monitoring the police scanner in the getaway car why didn't he pick up on Vincent organising the roadblock via walkie talkie?", "Presumably, Hanna knew that Neil habitually monitored police frequencies, since undoubtedly, in the forensics investigation into the armored car robbery, they found remains of the police scanners in the ambulance (and would probably have assumed that he did so anyway given how well prepared and technically adroit Neil's crew had proven to be). Therefore he would have used encrypted frequencies within his team and possibly employed cell phones to contact the patrol units (in addition to just grabbing whatever uniformed officers were present in the police station when the information came in). Once the shooting starts, the dispatcher's center would have been flooded with 911 calls leaving Neil's crew no choice but to quickly blast their way out before the essentially endless stream of police reinforcements overwhelm them (we see additional officers start arriving as Hanna chases Neil and the wounded Shiherlis into the parking lot)."], ["What happens to the key players in the story?", "The Thieves\n\nNeil McCauley escapes the final robbery with Chris Shiherlis. While heading to his new escape route with his girlfriend Eady, Nate calls him to tell him that Neil is in the clear. Nate is also compelled to tell Neil where Waingro was hiding. Neil decides to settle the score with Waingro. As Neil is heading back to his car where Eady is waiting for him, he sees Hanna walking towards him. Neil hesitates, but then decides to leave Eady behind to escape on his own. Hanna chases him into an airfield and Neil gets the drop on Hanna. Fortunately for Hanna, he sees Neil's shadow projected from the lights of a plane, and in a split second decision, Hanna turns his pistol and puts four rounds in Neil. As Neil lies there dying, Hanna approaches him, Neil says \"Told you I'm never going back [to prison]\". Neil offers his hand, and Hanna clutches it and waits with Neil as he dies.\n\nChris Shiherlis is shot in the clavicle by Det. Casals during the shootout, he and Neil escape the scene in a stolen car after Neil fires several suppressive bursts on Hanna and a few other cops. Neil then takes Chris to a trusted doctor to get patched up. Chris insists on going to get his wife and child, but Neil tries to convince Chris that the police are anticipating that and will have a trap set up for him. Chris ignores this and goes for Charlene. She appears on a balcony to him but gives him a signal that it's a trap. So Chris plays it off as asking for directions to someone on the street. He is stopped by the police, but he has a fake I.D. and the car he drove hadn't been reported as stolen, so they let him go. He then drives off with his share of the money, alone.\n\nMichael Cheritto is separated from Neil and Chris during the shootout. As he is escaping he trips and falls into a fountain, allowing Hanna time to draw a bead on him. When Michael gets up he grabs a young girl near the fountain and uses her as a human shield while firing at the other cops, unable to notice Hanna behind him. When he turns, he barely has time to react before Hanna shoots him in the head, killing him instantly.\n\nDonald Breedan is hit by gunfire while driving the getaway car towards the roadblock. It appears he was shot in the head and dies at the scene.\n\nTrejo calls Neil shortly before the final bank heist was supposed to happen saying that the police were all over him and he couldn't shake them. He then says to Neil that the last thing he wanted to do was let him down. He wasn't present for the final bank heist, so Neil deduces that it was Trejo who ratted them out to the police. Neil goes into Trejo's house (likely with the intention of killing him) to find Trejo's wife beaten to death and Trejo also horribly injured, and barely alive. Neil asks Trejo why he betrayed them; Trejo reveals that they forced him to because they were holding his wife hostage (this can be viewed in a deleted scene). He tells Neil it was Waingro and Van Zant who were responsible before asking Neil to put him out of his misery. Neil obliges by shooting him.\n\nNate, though not a thief, is a broker and friend of Neil's. Unless any of the ensuing chaos could be traced back to him, which it is implied it didn't, he was free and clear. Given that Nate is such a valuable connection with a lot of experience in the criminal world, he probably knew a million ways not to be implicated in these types of underworld deals.In other scripts it shows Vincent Hanna and 2 of his officers arrest Nate the Fence after he for the last time talked to Neil McCauley.\n\nCesar Kelso, the mastermind of the bank heist. Neil buys the information to the bank from him.\n\nCharlene Shiherlis: See the question Because Shiherlis never showed up to be apprehended by the cops, would Charlene go to jail?\n\nThe Crooks:\n\nWaingro, after learning that Neil and Chris escaped the bank robbery, he goes to hide out in a hotel under the name \"Jameson.\" Nate tells this to Neil, as Nate has a friend inside the LAPD who is staking out the hotel in case Neil makes a move on Waingro. Neil decides that he needs to settle the score with Waingro, so he infiltrates the hotel dressed as a security guard, bypasses all the police and security, breaks into Waingro's room and executes Waingro by shooting him twice in the chest and once in the head (a la the Mozambique Drill).\n\nRoger Van Zant: Neil goes to Van Zant's home, throws a patio chair through Van Zant's window while Van Zant is watching a hockey game, startling him. Neil aims his gun at Van Zandt and demands to know where Waingro is hiding. Roger replies \"How the hell would I know?\" so Neil shoots him three times in the chest.\n\nHugh Benny: The cops find out that he is the one who ratted the bank heist to the police, so Vincent and his team storm Benny's apartment. When Benny tries to resist, Vincent shoves him through his balcony door and proceeds to interrogate him. So he was likely arrested unless Vincent agreed to let him go if he gave up all the players.\n\nAlan Marciano: Agrees to set Charlene up in order to have charges against him dropped. He follows through, so he was likely released.\n\nThe Cops\n\nVincent Hanna: Catches his wife cheating on him, finds his step-daughter in his bath tub near-death due to her attemping suicide by cutting her wrists. Essentially his personal life has completely derailed, but by the end of the film he had caught or killed the criminals he was after, and seeing as how he was a career person more than a family person, he would likely get through it.\n\nSgt. Drucker  is last seen with Charlene, but we presume he continues working for Hanna.\n\nSchwartz  is shot in the shoulder by Cheritto during the bank robbery while firing from beside an LACMTA bus. He gets patched up and stays in the Robbery/Homicide office while the team try to net Neil and Chris. Earlier scripts had Schwartz being the detective killed in the shootout instead of Bosko (Ted Levine's character).\n\nBosko is part of the initial exchange of gunfire with Shiherlis during the bank robbery shootout. He is killed when Shiherlis shoots him in the neck.\n\nCasals stays in the robbery/homicide office with Schwartz except to help Vincent apprehend Hugh Benny."], ["Were Pacino and De Niro ever in the same scene together?", "Yes.

These include (in order of which they would appear):\n\n1. \"Season's Starting Early\" (00:32): Cheritto purchases hockey masks for the armored car robbery as well as a dollhouse for his daughter, falling in with the scenes of Neil stealing the ambulance and Shiherlis buying explosives.\n\n2. \"Nicest Guy on the Block\" (00:39): Cheritto arriving back at his domestic hearth, playing with his kids, giving his wife Elaine (Susan Traylor) a packet of money, and then looking mysteriously dazed.\n\n3. \"Albert and Hanna\" (00:18): An alternate and expanded take of Hanna's conversation with Albert Torena (Ricky Harris).\n\n4. \"Shakedown\" (00:27): Hanna and Sergeant Drucker try rattling the cages by pressing a shady TV repairman named Cuzomano. Cuzomano is mentioned in the movie at the scene of the armored car robbery, when Hanna is assigning detectives the names of fences to interrogate.\n\n5. \"Murder in C Block\" (00:34): An expanded version of the dialogue between Hanna and Richard Torena (Tone Loc), where Richard provides more detail to Hanna on how \"I could get killed for telling you this sh**!\" with the effect of illustrating Cheritto's ruthlessness, even behind bars.\n\n6. \"Let's Dance\" (00:45): Expanded restaurant scene between Hanna and his wife Justine (Diane Venora), dancing and talking about how they got married in the first place.\n\n7. \"Late Arrival\" (00:38): Expansive of McCauley's crew discussing how they got made, with Cheritto arriving late, showing the transponders used to monitor his car, and making a guess as to how the cops got on to them (dialogue elsewhere in the movie confirms the suspicion voiced in this deleted bit).\n\n8: \"Where's Ana?\" (02:19) The scene begins with Breedan dropping the crew off in front of the bank, with Neil informing Breedan that there will be no police response time, as they've bypassed the alarm. We then see Trejo arriving at his hillside house. He finds several of Van Zant's men, including Hugh Benny and Waingro, waiting for him inside. We learn that he has been blackmailed into betraying Neil. Benny then makes a phone call to the police, to send the police to the bank and spark the shootout. Trejo throughout the scene constantly asks for his wife's whereabouts. It then dawns on him, and he runs into the next room, followed by Waingro, wielding a baseball bat.

There are no such statements in any filmed version, and we are apparently led to believe that Arrius still lives when the film ends.\n\nThe 1925 version includes a subplot regarding Simonides' imprisonment and torture to get him to reveal the location of the Hur family riches, which he tried to keep hidden upon their imprisonment. In the 1959 version, we meet Simonides and his imprisonment/interrogation is spoken of, but never actually seen.\n\nThe filmed versions end at the crucifixion and its immediate aftermath.\n\nThe novel elaborates and goes into Christians going into hiding to create places of worship. _Ben-Hur_ (qv) becomes a Christian far earlier in the book.\n\nMessala's final fate differs. In the novel, he is killed in a jealous rage by his mistress Iras (who does not appear in the 1959 version at all), whereas in the 1959 film we are lead to believe he dies of injuries sustained in the chariot race.\n\nIn the 1925 version, _Ben-Hur_ (qv)'s identity in the chariot race is meant to be anonymous with no one knowing who he is, and people referring to this unidentified racer as \"The Unknown Jew.\" Messala uses his mistress Iras to attempt to discover who he is.

Cole's mission was never to change the past, which he repeatedly states cannot be done, but rather to find a sample of the pure virus which could be sent back to his time for analysis, in hopes that they could at least create a cure for all the virus' mutations, and make the Earth habitable again in that future. At the end of the film, Cole identifies the carrier of the virus, and although Cole himself dies, his information allowed one of the scientists to go to the past from the future, and obtain a sample of the virus, thereby making the hope for an eventual cure possible. Note that the female scientist is clearly the same age in the modern setting as she is in the future scenes, ruling out the notion that her younger self just happens to have been on the plane with the carrier. It is strongly implied that the scientists from the future planned Cole's death because he refused to return to his own time, and they could not allow him to disturb the past any further. They send Jose ('Jon Seda' (qv)) through time to give Cole an ancient gun and instructions to complete his mission. They might have intended that Cole try to use the gun in a(n) (futile) attempt to kill the carrier of the virus. The scientists probably knew it would not work and would cause security personnel to neutralize him, while the female scientist herself made sure the mission was completed."], ["Why can't the future be changed, as Cole says?", "There are roughly two major schools of thought on the subject of time travel in (science) fiction. One is that a timeline is 'flexible' and can be changed. When a certain outcome is undesireable, one needs to travel back to a point in the past, and change whatever caused the undesiarable outcome to happen. For instance, in order to save your mother from being run over by a car, you travel back in time so that you can push her out of the car's way and save her life. Most popular movies about time-travel adhere to this principle (e.g. _Back to the Future (1985)_ (qv), _Donnie Darko (2001)_ (qv) and _The Butterfly Effect_ (qv)) (2004).\n\nAnother theory is that the timeline is 'fixed' and can't be changed. The present is already the result of the past plus all attempts to try and manipulate the present. This implies that whatever you try to prevent by traveling back in time will be unsuccesful, or, worse, instrumental in causing whatever you tried to prevent. In case of the mother example, according to this theory, you can travel back in time to a moment before she was hit, but any action you might take will not be succesful in saving her. Possible scenarios are that you don't make it in time for some reason: perhaps in your hurry, you are hit by a car yourself, or you could shout at her to watch out for the car, thereby distracting her from the traffic, and thus causing her death. Movies following this principle are _Sphere (1998)_ (qv), _Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (2004)_ (qv), _The Time Machine (1960)_ (qv), and _Twelve Monkeys_ (qv).\n\nCole says that the future can't be changed, which proves to be true. Throughout the movie we see and hear about things that are said to happen in the future, and they all inevitably happen. Of course, the main event is that the global virus infection occurs. Cole's mission is not to prevent it, because the scientists know he can't; the very fact that the infection happened is evidence that it could not be prevented anyway. Furthermore, by traveling back into the past, Cole sets in motion a chain of events that lead to the very future he comes from, e.g. the mysterious recording by Kathryn to the future, in which she identifies the Army of the _Twelve Monkeys_ (qv) as the source of the virus. Cole and the scientists hear the recording and Cole is sent back in time to investigate; however, because of Cole's interactions with Kathryn Railly, he causes Kathryn to make this recording. In essence, the events that trigger him to travel through time actaully cause them, which is known as a time paradox.\n\nThe fact that the future is set does not prevent Cole from trying to change it anyway. It is in his nature to try, simply because he does not know the exact details of what caused that particular future to happen and what his failure in trying was. For instance, it is known in the future that there was an outbreak of a virus, but not who or what started it. After the Army of the _Twelve Monkeys_ (qv) appeared to be a dead end, Cole and Kathryn identify the real perpetrator at the airport, and try to stop him. This ends in Cole's death, which is witnessed by the young Cole, explaining the strange dreams he always had. It had never occurred to the young Cole that he actually saw himself dying, so the adult Cole never knew what fate would await him if he would try to prevent the virus outbreak."], ["Why doesn't the female scientist stop the virus outbreak at the end?", "Because she has to maintain the timeline, and the future can't be changed. If she had, then a grandfather paradox would occur, where the result of a time journey would prevent the time travel itself from occurring: if the scientist were to stop Dr. Peters from releasing the virus in all the other cities, the virus outbreak would be restricted to the United States, and there would (probably) not be a global outbreak. In that case, there would be no need to send anyone back to the past, and in turn this would mean that there would be no one to stop the outbreak from occurring. This would, again, cause a global virus outbreak, which would prompt the scientists again to travel backwards in time, and so on. In short, the world would get stuck in a cause-and-effect loop. One way to get out of this is to let the future run its course. The scientist ensures that she returns to the future that she left behind, with the cure needed to get the remainder of mankind back to the surface of the Earth."], ["Is the female scientist from the \"future\" scenes an older Dr. Railly?", "Almost certainly not, though speculation on this subject has popped up now and again. For one, the script refers to this scientist as \"the astrophysicist,\" while Railly was a psychiatrist. The film itself does not tend to suggest this, as the older scientist shows no apparent connection, emotional or otherwise, with James Cole. Terry Gilliam, in various discussions and commentaries appearing on the DVD (and the laserdisc before that) makes no such indication. But the most damning piece of evidence can be found in the screenplay, such as in this final scene, where the female scientist meets Dr. Peters on the airplane:DR. PETERS' POV: the FELLOW TRAVELER, a silver haired gentleman in a business suit, offering his hand congenially. DR. PETERS doesn't know who this man is, but we do. It's the ASTROPHYSICIST!\n\nASTROPHYSICIST: Jones is my name.

Believe it or not, there are rules and an expected code of conduct within the mafia, and there are certain actions that require the approval of a family Boss.

These safe houses are apartments, the majority of whose rooms are filled with mattresses for soldiers to sleep on. Thus, to \"go to the mattresses\" is to begin a war with the other Families. Another explanation comes from the novel: during a gang war, both sides would make use of vacated apartments owned by the crime family in question at key strategic points in the city. The apartments would be used to house soldiers that could be deployed to conduct \"battles\" between the families at a moment's notice. Because the war could go on for months or years, the apartments would be outfitted with mattresses for the men to sleep on. There would probably also be a phone in the apartment so they could be contacted quickly to move to an area to conduct family business. Clemenza, Rocco Lampone, and Paulie travel to New York to inspect some of the apartments and to begin the process of buying the actual mattresses to stock them with.

Sicilian and Italian tradition dictates that NO ONE, no matter how powerful or influential, will interfere in an Italian/Sicilian marriage. Vito is a very traditional man and had no intention of intruding in his daughter's marriage, even if it meant that Carlo ('Gianni Russo' (qv)) was abusive. There's a brief moment when everyone is eating lunch after Vito returns home from the hospital where Carlo tells Connie to shut up, Sonny tells Carlo never to say that to her, and Sonny's mother quietly tells Sonny \"don't interfere.\" In the novel, Connie goes to her parents a few times to tell them how abusive Carlo is but her parents, especially the Don, are very coldly unsympathetic to her plight and tell her to go home and learn how to be an obedient wife who won't be physically abused. Of course, no matter how Connie acts, dutiful or not, Carlo continues to beat her and eventually uses his abuse as a ruse to entice Santino to leave his compound without protection which is when he was murdered on the causeway. One aspect of the novel is that Vito and the rest of the family dissaproved of Connie getting married to Carlo because they sensed that Carlo is a cowardly thug who targets and abuses weaker people, and probably abuses his own authority. But once Connie made up her mind and got married to Carlo anyway, Vito decided to allow the abuse as a means of saying \"I told you so\" about Carlo being abusive and violent. Another aspect of the novel that's not very well-explained in the film is that Carlo is deeply and angrily resentful that he wasn't given a higher post in the Corleone family, e.g., a lieutenant's rank like Clemenza or Tessio. Instead, Vito gives Carlo charge of a family gambling office on the Upper East Side of Manhattan. Carlo is given a \"living\", a fine apartment, possessions, and money, but he's not allowed any more than that. In the novel, only after Michael starts to take over the family does Carlo get a better position. His bad habits ultimately diminish into almost nothing."], ["What service did Bonasera perform for Don Corleone?", "Although the film makes this pretty obvious, it still gets asked a lot. Vito asks Bonasera ('Salvatore Corsitto' (qv)) to patch up Sonny's dead body so that he looks presentable for his mother at his funeral. Sonny's body was probably shot up so badly by the Barzini hitters (and kicked in the face) as an insult to the Don so they couldn't have an open casket at the funeral. Given how many shots were pumped into Sonny with Thompson machine guns, it must have been an incredibly difficult process for Bonasera, which is why the Don says, \"I want you to use all your powers and all your skills...\" Also, such a job probably would have cost the Don tens of thousands of dollars, even at that time, and Bonasera's \"favor\" must have also included waiving his fee or at least reducing it greatly.

During the meeting, it is Barzini who repeatedly reprimands Vito for refusing to share his police and political protection to the drug operation. Vito figures he would only be taking offense so strongly if he were the man behind the operation."], ["How did Michael know about Carlo and Sonny?", "From the beginning, Carlo was never a trusted member of The Family, as evidenced by his low position as bookmaker (i.e., running a gambling office and not being given a higher post in the family's crime dealings) and Vito's instructions to Tom to allow Carlo to earn a living but to never discuss Family business in front of him. Carlo is a cowardly thug who knows that he is not valued by Don Corleone, but he cannot take his frustrations out on Vito, Sonny, or any of the other high-ranking members of the Family, so he does the next best thing - he is abusive toward Connie. Carlo's treatment of his wife leads to further distrust by Don Corleone. Additionally, it puts strain on his relationship with Sonny\u2014though the relationship isn't fully explained in the movie, in the novel we learn that Sonny and Carlo have been lifelong friends. When Sonny confronts Carlo about abusing Connie, Carlo instead flees and Sonny brutally beats him up on the street in his own neighborhood in front of Carlo's own men. In the scene, Carlo is clearly displayed as a coward since he makes no attempt to fight Sonny or hit him back. After Sonny beats him up, Carlo feels completely humiliated and seeks vengeance against Sonny. When Barzini (apparently hearing about the incident) asks for his help in setting up Sonny, Carlo is more than happy to comply.\n\nVito himself likely suspected Carlo's role in Sonny's murder, but since he could not prove it (and he didn't want to tip his hand so early), he pretends not to know. Connie, being the youngest child of Vito, had been spoiled and doted upon all her life and Vito doesn't want to see her widowed during his lifetime, something that, despite how horribly Carlo treats her, would upset Connie greatly and make her resent him. A little later, Michael is informed of the sequence of events that took place the day of Sonny's murder by Vito, Tom, Connie and others: a mystery woman calls Connie and Carlo's apartment to ask for him, Connie gets angry and starts to throw a tantrum giving Carlo an \"excuse\" to beat his wife knowing full well that she will call Sonny and tell him that Carlo has beaten her again. It is possible that Carlo may have somehow the Barzini people know that Sonny is on his way to the city, thus giving them the opportunity to trap him at the toll booth on the Causeway. It's all a little too convenient, and yet Michael still cannot be 100% certain that Carlo was involved.\n\nWhen Michael sits down with Carlo in the final scenes of the movie, he needs to know without a doubt that Carlo was responsible before giving the go-ahead. He decides to bluff to get the cowardly Carlo to admit to his role in Sonny's assassination. It works, and once Michael has confirmation that he has good reason to make his sister a widow, he gives the order to kill Carlo. Carlo's position as son-in-law was the only thing that allowed him to live as long as he did. When Connie finds out her husband is dead, she hysterically says to Michael, \"you waited until Pappa died so no one could stop you, and you killed him!\" Had Carlo been anyone else in ranking, he would have been taken out right after Sonny's murder."], ["How did Sonny know that it was Paulie who sold Vito out?", "It is more apparent in _The Godfather_ (qv) Saga as there is additional footage shown pertaining to this.

Similar to the Carlo situation, it's just too convenient that Paulie was out sick on the day of the hit; therefore, they got rid of him. In the book, the Corleones have a contact at the phone company that gives them a log of calls by Paulie and Clemenza ('Richard S. Castellano' (qv)), who was also a suspect. By these, they figure out that Paulie was the traitor. In the film, while we now know for certain that Paulie did in fact betray the family, in the original cut of the film, Sonny gives the order to eliminate Paulie without any hesitation or concrete evidence. This could have been meant as a foreshadowing of Sonny's reign as Don; it shows that he'd rather just act on impulse and have a member of his crew killed without any concrete evidence that he did betray them."], ["Doesn't Michael break Vito's promise to the Commission with his actions at the end of the movie?", "Technically, no. Vito's goal in bringing the Commission together is to bring an end to the war in the hope of allowing Michael to return safely to America. Sonny has just been brutally murdered, and the war has gone on long enough, with heavy losses on both sides, both in resources and personnel. Despite their differences, the other men in The Commission know Don Corleone to be a man of his word, so when he swears that he will not seek vengeance for Sonny's death in the interest of ending the violence, the other heads of the Families believe that they will be safe from any acts of vengeance under Don Corleone's orders. However interested he may be in restoring the peace, Vito is hardly a pushover, so it is somewhat puzzling to Tom Hagen (and the audience) why Vito would be so quick to roll over and promise to not seek vengeance in the murder of his eldest son. However, if you listen carefully to the words Vito chooses, he says: \"But that aside, let me say that I swear, on the souls of my grandchildren, that I will not be the one to break the peace we have made here today.\" In that speech, Vito is only making promises about his own actions, but he says nothing about his successor (Michael) being able to seek revenge later on. When Michael returns from Sicily, he immediately begins learning the ropes from Don Vito, in preparation for the day when Vito would retire or die, and Michael would take over as head of The Family. This is specifically addressed in a deleted scene. Michael and Vito are talking in the garden after Michael has taken over as the Don, and Michael says \"You gave your word that you wouldn't break the peace. I didn't give mine. You don't have to have any part. I take all responsibility.\" Vito smiles and responds, \"We have a lot of time to talk about it now\", showing that this is what he had always hoped Michael would do."], ["Why did Michael go from being the sweet and innocent civilian to cold-hearted and ruthless?", "There are many events in this film that cause him to take such a turn, the first being that he felt he was forced to join the family in order to help keep his father from being killed, e.g., the incident at the hospital. Also he committed two acts of cold-blooded murder (Virgil Sollozzo and Captain McCluskey ('Sterling Hayden' (qv))), because he felt he was the only one who could get close enough to those two men. Then he had to spend about a year hiding out in Italy. In the novel, Puzo makes mention of the boredom that Michael feels at having to wander Sicily. He learns much about the Mafia and its traditions as well as the frame of mind of men like his father. This is probably the point at which he turned into the Don he would become. He meets and falls in love with a young beautiful Sicilian woman. Shortly after they're married, they plan to move back to America. However, one of Michael's trusted bodyguards betrays him and places a bomb in a car that explodes and kills Michael's wife, causing Michael to close off his emotions from his business. In turn, this let him become a much more calculated and ruthless Don."], ["Was Fabrizio ever found?", "Yes, but the scene didn't make it into the final version of the film. There's a deleted scene in the DVD extras that shows Fabrizio ('Angelo Infanti' (qv)) getting into a car outside a restaurant. The car explodes an instant later. In the novel, the scene is much different. Fabrizio is found working in a pizzeria in Buffalo, New York and is shot by a Corleone operative. The killer IDs Fabrizio by an elaborate tattoo he had on his chest."], ["How does the movie end?", "While Michael is attending the baptism of his godchild, Carlo and Connie's new son, each of the Dons of the other leading Families in New York plus Moe Greene ('Alex Rocco' (qv)) in Las Vegas are murdered by Corleone assassins. Following the baptism, Michael ties up the rest of loose family business. First, he has Sal Tessio ('Abe Vigoda' (qv)) escorted away, presumably to be killed. He visits Carlo, having learned of his involvement in Sonny's murder, and gives him a plane ticket to Vegas. When Carlo gets into the car for his trip to the airport, he is garroted from behind. Michael goes home, where he is confronted by an hysterical Connie, who has figured out that it was Michael who ordered the assassination of Carlo. Kay ('Diane Keaton' (qv)) asks Michael if it's true, but he denies it. When Kay leaves the room to fix some tea, three of Michael's capos enter. One of them kisses Michael's hand and calls him 'Don Corleone.' Kay realizes then that Michael has become the new Don."], ["Was there a song based on the theme song for '_The Godfather_ (qv)'?", "Indeed there was.

Is he as bad a husband as he is a Don?", "Actually, he's quite the opposite. In the books, Sonny is described as being a kind and loving man to both his wife and children. Although he is most certainly a bad Don (something that his own father, even after Sonny's death, couldn't deny) he is a wonderful father and husband. His infamous temper is never taken out on his children or wife; Sonny is described as never being able to bring himself to hurt something helpless, especially women and children. As for his infidelity with Lucy Mancini, there's an explanation for that in the book as well. In a highly unusual turn of events, Sonny's wife, Sandra, is well aware that Sonny sleeps with other women and actually prefers it that way. It is described in the book that Sonny Corleone has an abnormally large penis, so large that it actually gives his wife stomachaches. Lucy Mancini, who it turns out has a congenitally loose vagina, is able to deal with the size of Sonny's penis and thus they start an affair. Their affair, however, is purely sexual: Lucy doesn't love Sonny and barely knows him outside of their affair, and Sonny is purely in love with only his wife. This is slightly alluded to in the film. During the wedding at the beginning, Sonny's wife is talking with other women at the table and she holds her hands up in a \"this big\" pose and gradually holds her hands out wider and wider, much to the amazement of the other women. She turns to Sonny, but sees that he's gone and a slight look of hurt and/or despair crosses her face. The scene then cuts to Sonny having sex with Lucy. Lucy has a much larger role in the novel, mostly due to an entire subplot, including several main characters not found in the film, including a plastic surgeon, who \"repairs\" her large vagina, his and Lucy's back-stories, plus their eventual involvement after her affair with Sonny ends (due to his death). This subplot has little to do with the main story of Vito and Michael, and so it was easily excised for the screen version."], ["Why does Michael fire Tom as consigliere?", "There are probably many differing reasons for Michael's actions. Here are a few ideas:\n\n1. Michael was planning the massacre of the other heads of the New York crime families & Tom might have tried to talk him out of it. The war between the Five Families had been over for a few years and peace had generally been reigning for about that long & Tom might have tried to convince Michael not to commit any more violence. When the big meeting takes place between Michael, Clemenza, Tessio, Tom and Carlo where Michael 1st announces his desire to move the Corleone family to a legitimate business status, he talks about \"negotiations being made that are going to answer all of your questions and solve all of your problems\" in answer to Tessio's and Clemenza's frustration over Barzini moving in on their respective territories in New York. Those plans likely included the massacre. During the meeting the Don tells Tom, \"... there are reasons why you must have nothing to do with what's going to happen\", referring to the massacre that Michael was plotting to make the Corleone family the most powerful crime organization in New York again.\n\n2. Michael and Vito might have placed some of the blame for Sonny's assassination on Tom. Though it turns out that Carlo Rizzi plotted with Barzini to set Sonny up, Michael and Vito probably believed that Tom didn't do enough to stop Sonny from leaving the safety of the family compound that day to find Carlo. Part of Tom's job as consigliere is not only to advise the Don on strategy and business dealings but also to protect the don, especially during times of inter-family war. Think of Tom as the US President's chief of staff in that regard, a person who acts as an ambassador to the President's top advisers. During the meeting mentioned above the Don tells Tom, \"I advised Michael\" (on Tom's ouster), and further says, \"I never thought you were a bad consigliere. I thought Santino was a bad Don, rest in peace.\"\n\n3. Michael also says, \"you're not a wartime consigliere, Tom.\" The Don had convinced Michael that Tom wasn't up to the task of being consigliere anymore, especially when the tide was going to turn toward further acts of violence. Instead, Michael goes along with the idea of having his own father be his consigliere because Vito had reigned over the family during previous conflicts with their enemies/rivals. Though Vito dies before the massacre takes place, he was alive long enough to help Michael plan it. Tom wouldn't have wanted to take this course of action & would likely offer poor advice or have tried to stop it. Tom had the ability to advise the Don on what business dealings to secure, but violence wasn't his thing."], ["Why does Sonny destroy the guy's camera? Why does Barzini have the other photographer's camera seized?", "The obvious reason was that the guy was getting too close to the party (he was standing near the gate to the Corleone compound) taking photos of who came to the wedding and their cars, even license plates. The event was, of course, a private one and the Corleones had hired their own photographers. The photographer was probably working for the FBI, whom Sonny had spit at when the agent flashed his badge moments earlier.\n\nAn event like this one would have many of the Corleone's own operatives in attendance (for security purposes) and perhaps even some of Vito Corleone's rivals there as well. Such is the case with Barzini. It's also entirely possible the man was a reporter and doing a story on the wedding. Sonny was angered at the fact that someone would try and violate his family's privacy, especially at his sister's wedding. The scene also serves to introduce us to Sonny's famous hair trigger temper. Yet, Sonny, after breaking the guy's camera, throws him some cash out of his own wallet obliviously to compensate him for destroying the camera as well as to prevent the guy from suing him and the Corleones for assault and battery and destruction of personal property (the camera).\n\nReal life mafioso dons, bosses and under-bosses of the era, unlike the modern dons like John Gotti, mostly maintained a very low profile by avoiding talking to the press and kept up a modest lifestyle (at least publicly) to such an extent that even photos of Mafia heads were rare. There were a few exceptions, like the flamboyant Bugsy Seigal who cavorted with movie stars and maintained a glamorous life-style, which caused great consternation among his fellow mob confederates, as it called attention to their illegal dealings. Most Mafia Dons of the era represented in _The Godfather_ (qv) (mid-'40s to the late '50s, the time-frame altered slightly from the novel) were unknown to the general public and even the FBI was unsure of which individuals actually ran the rackets and who answered to whom.\n\nAlso, the very hierarchical structure of the Mafia was largely unknown until major figures turned federal informants decades later. By observing Mafia figures at weddings and funerals, the only public events the press-shy and camera-shy Dons would regularly attend, hints as to the ranks and strengths of the various families could only be ascertained by observing them in the public sphere. This is why the FBI regularly stalked Mafia members at public events, which were considered \"civilian\" family events by the families, and off-limits for business and crime dealings, which would have added to Sonny's frustration at their privacy being invaded. This is why Barzini makes sure to personally destroy the negatives of any photos taken of him and his associates, which might have been passed on to law-enforcement. The Corleone photographer taking the wedding photos himself might even have been an FBI plant."], ["Clemenza tells Michael, \"They shoulda stopped Hitler at Munich.\" What does that mean?", "Clemenza mentions the 1938 Munich Agreement when he talks to Michael about the impending war that will occur right after Michael assassinates Sollozzo and McCluskey. In September 1938, Hitler had sought to annex the Sudetenland, a region of Czechoslovakia populated mainly by ethnic Germans, to Germany. An international crisis ensued and a major conference was held in the German city of Munich to resolve the issue. At this conference, the western powers, led by British Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain, agreed to allow Hitler to annex the Sudetenland in exchange for his promise to leave the rest of Czechoslovakia alone. Chamberlain felt that Hitler's territorial ambitions could be contained with minor concessions and, after Munich, declared that they had achieved \"peace in our time\". However, Hitler promptly violated his promise and occupied the entirety of Czechoslovakia. After the outbreak of war in 1939, Chamberlain was widely criticized for failing to stand up to Hitler at Munich. The conference, and the concept of appeasement, came to be derided as examples of political cowardice in the face of an aggressive upstart foe. So Clemenza is comparing the Corleone's position to that of Britain in 1938. They face an aggressive upstart with Sollozzo. In Clemenza's opinion it is better to deal with Sollozzo now, rather than try to appease him and have to deal with him in the future when he's much more powerful."], ["Was The Horse's Head a real horse head or a fake one?", "For the rehearsals, the horse's head was fake.

So he asked Luca to pretend to be unhappy with the Corleone family and go to the Tattaglias to find out what he could about their deal with Sollozzo. When meeting with Bruno Tattaglia and Sollozzo, Sollozo offers Luca $50,000 to come and work for him instead. When Sollozzo offers his hand to make the deal, Luca doesn't accept it. This may be because Luca thinks of himself as honourable, knowing he wasn't actually betraying the Corleones, he couldn't in good conscience shake Sollozzo's hand to make the deal. Which tipped Sollozzo that Luca was trying to spy (or he simply took offense to the snub) which is why he stabs Luca in his right hand while one of Tattaglia's men strangled Luca. He may have also become suspicious that someone like Luca, who had a reputation for being a fiercely loyal Corleone enforcer would so easily betray them for some money. Michael may have become aware of this; as in _The Godfather_ (qv) Part III, he tells Vincent to go to Don Altobello and act displeased with Michael, but if Altobello asked him to betray Michael, to act offended. Because that would be his trap to determine his loyalty. Alternatively, Sollozzo needed Luca out of the way because he was already planning the hit on Vito and even if he hoped Luca's defection was real, Luca likely wouldn't be happy about them killing Vito. So Luca had to die. As Tom says, \"Not even Sonny will be able to call off Luca Brasi\", to which Sollozo replied, \"Yeah, well let me worry about Luca\", as he already had him taken care of."]], "0103064": [["A Note Regarding Spoilers", "The following FAQ entries may contain spoilers.

They just happen to have the same (or similar given Arnold's aging from 1984-1991) flesh and skin coating."], ["How can the T-1000 go through the time machine? It has no living tissue!", "The T-1000 is liquid metal; only living human tissue will go through the time machine. The T-800 can go through because the metal endoskeleton is surrounded by human tissue. But the movie leaves some mystery as to what the machine actually is; when in its human form, the T-1000 might actually mimic human flesh. However, since the film really never specifically explains on the situation, it's considered a plot hole. Reese states in the original film that it has something to do with the field generated by a living organism, which is probably bioelectromagnetism, but doesn't elaborate further. That doesn't necessarily mean that only human or animal tissue can travel through time intact. It may mean that anything (machines included) that generates the proper kind of field can time travel. Since the T-1000 is so far advanced, it may generate the right type of field (that Reese was talking about) that earlier models could not without human flesh. Another option is that the T-1000 was outfitted with a simple layer of epidermis just before it was sent back through time. T-800s have a complete, fully functional skin with blood supply to keep the epidermis in shape and to ensure that wounds will heal, in order to keep the Terminator passable as a human. However, all the T-1000 may need is a simple layer of skin without blood vessels or other components of human flesh to get him across time, which he can dispose of after time-travel. Technically, we never really see in what state he arrived, and there was some time, maybe up to half a minute or so, between the electrical disturbances from the time-travel and T-1000's first on-screen appearance, where he kills the police officer. Perhaps he shed the skin in that short time. It is also possible that over time, SkyNet was able to advance the technology of the time machine allowing it to send anything through, whether it has living tissue or not."], ["Did the T-1000 specifically target a police officer to kill and take over the identity?", "No. The T-1000 would have killed and copied the clothing of the first adult male with whom he came into contact.

This information is described in the prologue of the official Terminator 2 novel where the original script can be read. However, after Reese was sent back in time, his unit (including an older John Connor) found liquid metal residue in Skynet's factories. It is implied that the T-1000 is an experimental unit at this point and that even Skynet is not fully sure of whether or not it can be controlled (due to how advanced it is, it may actually be more intelligent than Skynet, and has the potential to turn on its master). It is only to be activated as an act of desperation or a last resort should the humans actually destroy Skynet. John then decides to send a reprogrammed T-101 back to wherever the liquid metal creation was sent before destroying the Time Displacement equipment. One must also keep in mind that during the events of the first Terminator film, Reese and Sarah are only together for around 48 hours. Reese does not have a great deal of time to give a full description of future events and the full extent of the enemy's arsenal, and he is not even aware of the T-1000's existence (as it is a secret weapon). John Connor is the only one that is aware of it, and only because it was sent back in time to kill him. Why he could not himself have given this knowledge to Reese before the time journey depends upon the (as yet unproven) way in which time travel to the past would work, i.e. if there would be multiple, revised iterations of events, or if all events would piece together into a single continuity. An early T2 script (which can be read in _Terminator 2: Judgment Day_ (qv): The Book Of The Film - An Illustrated Screenplay) also contained a comparable opening scene in the future, where the human resistance defeats the machines, enters the Skynet building, and sends Reese to the past. After he is gone, the men want to blow up the Time Displacement equipment, but John Connor tells them there is still one more thing to do. He goes into a cold storage room where several inactive T-101 Terminators are stored; one is already missing (an Arnold model). John looks at another, knowing he still needs to send this one to protect himself in the past. This scene was never shot for budgetary and other reasons."], ["If the T-101 is a known multiple murderer from the first movie, why would the human resistence send back an identical model?", "According to the James Cameron/Bill Wisher original script draft and the official novelization by Randall Frakes, as well as creative consultant Van Ling, there were hundreds of different-looking T-101s in Skynet's terminator storage facility. However, the adult Connor went looking specifically for the T-101 that he remembered protecting him when he was ten years old. By sending back his father Kyle Reese and the protector terminator, John was fulfilling his role in the predestination paradox (causal loop). When John entered the Terminator Cold Storage Facility to locate the deactivated \"Arnold\" model, Frakes writes: John panned his light around. There were hundreds of men and women, in rows of ten. Within each row, the bodies were absolutely identical. John quickly walked along the synthetic bodies to the end of a row and hesitated. He scanned the faces. No, not there. Then he gazed down the other row. All the same. Strange to him. Then...he turned to another row and stopped. It was filled with identical, familiar faces. The broad, brutally handsome features sent a shock of recognition through John. It was him.\n\nBoth from the official Terminator 2 companion book and on the special edition T2 DVD, James Cameron and Stan Winston state that an unfilmed part of the script involved the rebels in 2029 destroying Skynet but finding a chamber where the T-101 model terminators were built. This chamber housed a sophisticated assembly line where the terminator parts were transported to a central point. Here they were welded together, programmed and placed inside a press that coated the outside of the endo-skeleton with a organic tissue. The point of this sequence was to show how the rebels managed to not only find the terminators but also the time displacement equipment that they could use to send back the reprogrammed T-101. This sequence was ultimately excised from the movie due to financial constraints, but Stan Winston liked it so much that he recreated it for the first teaser trailer for T2, released one year before T2's July 1991 release."], ["Where exactly is the T-1000's CPU located?", "Here are some clues from the official novel as to the nature of its design: (1) \"It didn't have a wafer-circuit brain to think with. It was something on a completely new level of artificial intelligence. The molecular brain acts like the rest of the thing, a liquid. And now it bubbled with possibilities. All of them lethal. \"[page 101], (2) \"The concept of pain had never factored into the sensory sphere of the liquid machine. Pain was an indicator of damage to a part of the organism. But this 'organism' didn't have parts, except on the molecular level. And its molecules were each primitive, miniaturized versions of the total machine. If any section parted, the separated halves would revert to metal poly-alloy. The only default command it had in molecular memory was to find the main mass again and rejoin it. Each molecule had a range of fourteen kilometres.\" [page 132], and (3) \"Skynet itself had hesitated before making this latest weapon. There were unpredictability factors related to the thing's longevity and ability to process commands without interpolating its own priorities. It was so volatile a construct, that only in the last throes of utter defeat, when the plug was about to be pulled, had Skynet sent the terminators through time to change the outcome of the war. And only in the very last micro-second before shutdown, had the hypercomputer sent the T-1000... Skynet had no choice. \"[page 178]"], ["Why didn't the T-1000 know how to quickly kill the T-800, an inferior model?", "The T-1000 has at least three hand-to-hand encounters with the T-800. At no point does it seem to have a direct understanding of how to efficiently disable it. The reasons behind this are not known, but there are several common suggestions:\n\n1. The T-1000 is a prototype and has incomplete programming about T-800 design/anatomy.\n\n2. The T-1000 simply wasn't designed or programmed to fight other terminators.\n\n3. T-800s in general are not easy to kill and as such, there may very well not be a simple, quick, \"efficient,\" way to simply destroy one. Their fuel cells are located in their abdominal area, but this location is heavily protected with thick armor. The same has to be true for their chip in their cranium. If bullets from most high powered rifles and handguns are unable to penetrate these areas, its unlikely a T-1000 would be able to stab through the armor either. Conflictingly a knife can penetrate armour designed to minimise bullet damage such as a bullet proof vest. A T-800 will have full military grade armour but this was pierced because the stabbing weapon had behind it the immense force generated by the T-1000 when it targeted the fuel cells. A human would unlikely manage to do the same although a purpose built bolt for a high power crossbow is feasible. It's assumed the T-1000 was unaware the T-800 had an alternative power supply.\n\n4. The T-1000's primary objective is to kill John Connor, not eliminate every threat that may interfere with this mission. Getting away, or delaying your enemy's advance, can be just as effective. Also, every moment spent fighting the T-800 gives John more time to escape. Losing track of him hinders its mission considerably. However, it is noteworthy that in the final hand-to-hand battle in the steel mill, the T-1000 did engage in a lengthy fight with the T-800. It may have allowed some time to do this thinking that it is unlikely that John would be able to get away under the current setting.\n\n5. The T-800 may be considered an \"inferior model\" but it clearly has considerable strength and abilities. The superiority spoken of may refer to total life span, the ability to change its form, less physical damage from bullet impacts, etc. Consider a knife vs. a gun. A gun may be superior, but a knife can still do a great deal of damage, even penetrating material which bullets can not."], ["When the silent alarm is tripped at Cyberdyne, Miles's access card no longer works.

What is the number he finds?", "7256."], ["Is the timeline altered when Cyberdyne is destroyed?", "Yes; according to James Cameron, Judgment Day, the nuclear war and Skynet are completely eradicated from all future timelines by the end of this movie. Basically, what I wanted to say in Terminator 2 was that everything is meant to be a certain way, everything has already been written. You can call it karma or destiny, whatever. So I asked myself a hypothetical question: what if you could you grab a line of history like it's a rope stretched between two points, and just pull it out of the way? If you can pull it just a little bit out of the way then cut it at that moment, maybe you could change it and history could go in a slightly different direction. Like the catastrophe theory. If you could actually do that you would get a future that no longer exists except in the memories of the people who are here now. They have a memory of a future that will never happen, which is curious, because it defies our Newtonian view of the world. But couldn't it be possible? That became my point of departure. It's like the Terminator is an anomaly of our time because he's the only one who has memories of a time that will never exist. His particular future does not exist anymore. - James Cameron\n\nHowever, this was changed in Terminator 3, and in the accompanying television series, neither of which were made with any input from the writers of the first 2 films.

Cameron did shoot an alternative ending almost 40 years in the future, where Judgment Day did not happen and the Earth was safe, but he deleted it because it was too cheerful compared to the rest of the movie, and not in line with the powerful message of the movie: that the future is not set. He chose a more ambiguous ending instead. However, we must also note that due to the films after T2, we must look to the predestination paradox to explain this answer. The predestination paradox explains that whatever has happened was meant to happen. A time traveller attempting to alter the past in this model, intentionally or not, would only be fulfilling his role in creating history as we know it, not changing it, or that the time-traveler's personal knowledge of history already includes his future travels to his own experience of the past. Effectively, it means this: the time traveller is in the past, which means he was in the past before. Therefore, his presence is vital to the future, and he does something that causes the future to occur the same way his knowledge of the future knows has already happened. What this means is that Judgement Day never really happened in 1997. Sarah Connor said that it would be in 1997 because she did not know what would happen in the events of T2. So, conclusively, if we look at the Terminator saga as a whole, the answer to this question is no. When time-travelling happens in the Terminator saga, nothing really changes, because what is done in the past has already affected the future in which the time-travellers came from."], ["How does the movie end?", "After freeing its arm from the cogwheel, the T-101 continues to pursue the T-1000 who has Sarah pinned by his left finger blade through her shoulder. The T-101 sneaks up behind and rams the T-1000 with a steel bar, but the T-1000 easily pulls it out and turns it on the T-101 then pounds him with a heavy metal beam, mashing his head and exposing his robotic eye. When the T-101 tries to get to his grenade launcher, the T-1000 impales him with the metal bar through his abdomen, pining him to the grated floor. The T-101 is zapped by electricity and goes limp. The T-1000 continues to go after John, mimicking Sarah's voice to lure him closer. Meanwhile, the T-101 boots back up using an alternate power route. He pulls out the iron bar, grabs the grenade launcher, and crawls up to the platform where the T-1000 has taken Sarah's form. Suddenly, the real Sarah appears behind the T-1000-Sarah and blasts it with several rounds from her shotgun until she runs out of ammo. The T-101 finishes with his grenade launcher, sending the T-1000 plummeting into a vat of metal.and is dissolved. John tosses in the remaining robotic arm and the microchip, and they rejoice that it's over. However, the T-101 reminds them that there is one more microchip...the one in his head...and that they must destroy him, too. John pleads with him to stay with them, but the Terminator won't take no for an answer. He can't terminate himself, so he hands Sarah the remote control and steps onto the pulley. Slowly, she lowers him into the vat of molten metal where he is consumed. In the final scene, Sarah and John drive down the highway, and Sarah says in an voiceover: 'The unknown future rolls towards us. I face it for the first time with a sense of hope. Because if a machine, a Terminator, can learn the value of human life, maybe we can too.'"], ["Why did the T-800 ask to be terminated? His mission was to ensure the survival of John Connor. Isn't that failing his mission?", "He does so to destroy all technology from the future that could lead to the development of Skynet, since the threat from the T-1000 was at an end. This would, in effect, be the greatest protection John could ever be afforded. Should Skynet pursue further assassination attempts to alter the time-line, the human resistance would most likely send a protector back in time to make sure the survival of the human resistance is not jeopardized; hence the release of Terminator 3, where the human resistance finds out a \"Terminatrix\" has been sent to destroy John's fellow lieutenants. Another protector, a T-850 model 101 terminator (this time reprogrammed by future Kate Brewster) is sent through time to defuse the threat against her life."], ["Why can't the T-800 self-terminate?", "The movie and the novel are in conflict concerning this question. In the novel, the T-800 immediately commits suicide by stepping into the molten steel once the T-1000 has died. In the movie, this moment is drawn out to generate emotional issues about the T-800's mortality. However, as a soldier doing a duty, the T-800 probably would not have required others to end his life when the future was at stake. The T-800's death sequence from the official novel: \"[The] Terminator put his hand on John's shoulder. 'I must complete my mission.' And as he said that, the human side of his face came back into the light. He reached toward John and his metal finger touched the tear trickling down his cheek. It was the revelation. 'I know now why you cry, although it is something I can never do.' He turned to Sarah and said, 'Goodbye.' 'Are you afraid?' There was the briefest instant before he responded. 'Yes,' he said. Not because he was going to cease functioning as a terminator, but because he had sensed a vision beyond his programming of a cosmic order vast beyond Skynet's comprehension. And it gave him a sense of his first feeling. Fear. Of where he was going next, if anywhere. Of course, he hadn't been asked for further details on his answer, so he didn't say any of this. He simply turned and stepped off the edge.\" [page 235] During the scene when collecting weapons from the hidden cache at the compound of Enrique, John Connor asks the T-800 if it felt fear. To this the T-800 simply replies, \"No.\" John then asks, \"Not even of dying?\" The T-800 again replies, \"No.\" John Connor presses further, \"You don't feel any emotion about it one way or another?\" This is when the T-800 says conflictingly, \"No, I have to stay functional until my mission is complete. Then it doesn't matter.\""], ["What about the T-800's lost arm in the steel mill?", "From the official novel: \"As the chromed skeleton was dissolved into the same primal stew as the T-1000, Sarah and John watched [the] Terminator sink into the lava, the metal hand going last... At the last second it formed into a fist with the thumb extended... a final thumbs-up. Then it was really gone. Mother and son watched the molten metal for a while. Then John remembered [the] Terminator's other arm back down the row of smelters, and ran to get it. It was a pile of useless, twisted metal, but the metal was from the future and this time they weren't leaving anything to chance. When John tossed the pieces in, one by one, he and Sarah felt a shudder deep within the bowels of the earth. As if a massive pivot was turning. Of course, later, John would think back and assume it was merely the huge machines pounding away in the mill. He would be wrong. History had been reborn.\" [page 236]"], ["Why does the T-1000 torture Sarah Connor in the steel mill?", "The T-1000 knows that in order to lure John out of hiding, he needs to put Sarah in danger, because John came to her rescue at the psychiatric hospital. Afterward, the T-1000 is then able to mimic Sarah just like he did with his other victims. In doing so, all he needed to do was call out John's name and let John see \"his mom\" hurting so he would go to her, therefore exposing himself to the T-1000. Luckily for John, the real Sarah was able to get back to him in time. Some consider this point in the story a plot hole, claiming the T-1000 did not imitate any of its earlier victims until they were dead. However, the T-800 explains that the T-1000 can mimic anything it samples merely via physical contact; it does not require the individual to be dead before it can take his/her form. The guard at the psychiatric hospital was sampled when he walked on the T-1000, who fully copied him before killing him. Sarah herself is sampled by the T-1000 during the torture scene. (Also, she might have been sampled in the elevator in Pescadero when the T-1000 is on top of the car, stabbing into it; one of those stabs slashes Sarah on the shoulder.) One can presume he was preparing to kill Sarah when the T-800 intervened, giving her time to escape. At that time, while torturing her, another objective the T-1000 might have had was to simply trick Sarah into speaking so it could sample her voice, another aspect to aide it in luring John to it.\n\nThe T-1000's decreasing efficacy is explained in a few scenes cut from the theatrical version of the film but are able to be viewed as part of the director's cut or on most versions of the DVD as a deleted scene. After being frozen in the liquid nitrogen and then shattered, the T-1000 starts to show evidence that it may be malfunctioning. As it is walking, its feet, up to about the knee, involuntarily imitate the diamond plate flooring it walks across and its hand bonds with and imitates a yellow-striped railing. The T-1000 itself seems confused by this but is unable to stop it. Later, when it calls John in Sarah's voice, the glitch occurs again: John glances down, and there's a quick shot of the T-1000 imitating the grating its standing on right before Sarah shoots it the 1st time. In the theatrical version, the only evidence of the glitch is the slight flutter that you see after it crushes Arnold's arm in the gear. This may explain why it moves much more slowly during the final conflict, which allows Sarah to escape while it is dealing with the T-800."], ["If the creation of Skynet was inspired by its own technology, how can any of this be possible?", "This is called an ontological paradox. It's not clear how these would resolve in reality. While it may be logically confusing to track exactly where and how Skynet originated, understanding of time and space in the future may have advanced enough to accept that Skynet needed to send terminators back through time, not to ensure its seeds were planted, but to protect its inevitable creation from its enemies like John Connor. This reasoning, however, goes deeper than what the movie descibes about Skynet's ambitions. Assuming that mankind will one day, be it in the near or distant future, invent microchips and machines smart enough to take over control, Judgment Day will also happen sooner or later. As a result of the human resistance, Skynet sends Terminators to the past to kill their leader and protect its own existence. However, they leave traces of their technology behind in the past, causing the creation of Skynet to occur earlier and the date of Judgment Day to be pushed backwards in the timeline. So Skynet's technology does not directly influence its own creation per se, but merely the time of its creation. Basically, despite the message of the film being that there is no fate, some things are inevitable, and even if the events of _The Terminator (1984)_ (qv) hadn't taken place, Skynet would eventually have been built somehow. The placing of the original arm only built the foundations quicker."], ["If Skynet believes it can alter the future, why is the T-800 hesitant about doing the same?", "The T-800's mission is to ensure the survival of John Connor. The fact that the future John Connor didn't reprogram the T-800 to consider such a side mission derives from an obvious inability to predict what Skynet might already have planned. It was better to simply escort the young John Connor into indefinite seclusion. Another possibility is that the future John had simply accepted the fact that, despite what he made Kyle memorise on the subject, while the future can be altered, the big picture remains pretty much the same. Also, if the Terminator did somehow purge Skynet's existence, John never would have been born."], ["How can there be sequels, Terminator 3, Salvation and Genisys, if all the technology concerning Skynet was destroyed?", "The 3rd and 4th film, along with the television series, can be alternative interpretations/spin offs, as James Cameron considered the story closed, with his own original ending featuring an elderly Sarah surrounded by grandchildren and John becoming a Senator in what appears to be a peaceful future time. According to the writers of the new films, while Skynet was physically destroyed, the idea of Skynet (i.e. A.I.) is irreversible and therefore the creation of Skynet was merely postponed. This is explained more clearly in a deleted scene from T3, which can be found on the DVD. Also, when the T-800 loses its arm in the gears during the fight at the steel mill, it is still there at the end of the movie; it wasn't destroyed in the molten steel like the rest. Another possibility is that Dyson wasn't the only one who brought work home, and other Cyberdyne workers could have the data for the chip on their home computers. There could also have been an offsite server that kept the files saved, so if the building was lost the files wouldn't be lost as well. If the future war never happens, then the Terminator never came back for the first movie, and neither did Kyle Reese. If Kyle Reese never came back, then there is no John Connor. If someone from the future changes the past and changing the present to one in which that future never happened, then theoretically you unmake the past, as well. This is all according to the Eternalism theory of time. The 'Growing Block' theory of time allows the events of this movie to take place (i.e., for there to never be a war, but the Terminators/Reese still travel back; likely what Cameron intended). If one takes the novelization of Terminator 3, all of the patents and research were backed-up off-site. After the company headquarters was lost; the Defense Department obtained the patents and contracted with the Air Force and Cyber Research Systems to continue Cyberdyne's artificial intelligence projects. Skynet's completion and Judgment Day was merely postponed 7 years. -- One could also consider an original timeline where Skynet was still developed by Cyberdyne even without the arm and cpu."], ["John demonstrates a knowledge for computer hacking. Is this Skynet's main concern?", "John shows an interest for hacking ATMs and manages to bypass the security systems at Cyberdyne. This could be why he is a threat to Skynet. Unfortunately, this character trait wasn't elaborated on in Terminator 3. This may indicate that the time-line has been altered with the destruction of Cyberdyne. However, it was Reese who said in The Terminator that it was John who taught the human resistance to fight and physically destroy the machines. The opening scene of T2 shows adult John coordinating the battle against the machines, and according to young John, he was instructed in all kinds of weapons in order to become a great military leader. This would suggest that tactical skills are still John's major talents. Additionally, in T3 John says, in his opening narration, that he chose to \"live off the grid\" meaning that he didn't want to have any sort of public identity, especially not one online, so that he wouldn't be found. His motivation for doing so is not entirely clear but we can probably assume it's because he didn't fully believe that Judgement Day had been prevented and that Skynet's existence had not entirely been wiped out. As it turns out, he was right. And his strategy works: the T-850 that's sent to protect him specifically says \"You could not be located, so Skynet sent another terminator to kill your lieutenants.\" That the T-X terminator found John was blind luck."], ["What methods are there for killing a Terminator?", "A T-800 is composed of solid armor, so it is resistant to small arms fire. It may be possible to damage or even destroy a T-800 with armor piercing bullets, but the movies never address this. Unlike the T-1000, the T-800 is unable to reform its chassis if it is damaged. Because of this, a T-800 can be destroyed with any type of explosive weapon, such as a grenade, a grenade launcher, a pipe bomb, a rocket launcher, etc. A directed energy weapon like a plasma rifle is probably the most common way to kill a T-800 in 2029. The characters in the movies did not have access to weapons like these for obvious reasons. Any significant damage to the structural integrity of the chassis will either disable or destroy the T-800, as is shown in the first movie with the hydraulic press. The answer for the T-1000 is more unclear. The second movie gives us a few hints. No type of firearm will permanently damage the T-1000, although being shot multiple times seem to slow it down for a few seconds, while it regains shape. When Arnold shoots the T-1000 with the grenade launcher, it seems to damage the T-1000 so significantly that it cannot immediately reform its original shape and even loses orientation. This may be because of the damage to the T1000 caused by being frozen by liquid nitrogen. We saw that the T1000 was malfunctioning after this from the way it involuntarily changed to its surroundings, once sticking to the railing and again when its feet exposed the ruse of pretending to be Sarah Connor. Apparently, shapeshifting takes time, as is also seen in the scene where it has spread out on the floor and then slowly forms into the shape of a man. Conclusively, explosive weapons are a vague possibility. The T-1000 is sensitive to extreme heat, therefore a plasma rifle or any other type of energy based weapon could either damage or destroy it. Exposing it to extreme heat, as is shown in Terminator 2, will kill it. Exposing it to extreme cold incapacitates the T1000's and has been shown to damage them also. This theoretically suggests the shattered pieces of frozen T1000 could have been collected up and kept in a frozen state, or perhaps dropped from air over a vast area of an ocean. The low temperature and the pressure on the ocean bed and the vast distances involved would make it improbable for the pieces to relocate each other."], ["Are there other ways besides extreme heat to deactivate the T-1000?", "Probably. This is suggested by a few shots that were cut from the Theatrical Version, and were restored in the Special Edition. After the T-1000 is frozen and thaws up again in the steel mill, he follows John, Sarah and Terminator. As he walks he grabs onto a steel yellow/black striped bar, and something strange happens: his hand automatically 'fuses' with the bar, mimicing the striped color pattern. He pulls himself loose, looks somewhat confused, and changes his hand back with a fast flick. He then enters an area with a metal profile floor, and his feet uncontrollably take over the color and texture of that floor. The last shot shows John with the two Sarahs, noticing that the feet of the first Sarah seem to be fused to the grated floor. These scenes show that the T-1000 has indeed been damaged by the nitrogen freezing, as he has difficulties maintaining his current shape; his shapeshifting abilities seem partly out of his control. This indicates that the T-1000, although extremely resilient, still consists of fragile microtechnology that can be damaged. Being metal, he could be vulnerable to certain acids as well. Also, because of the heat from the steel mill, it is possible that the extreme heat was assisting in the adhering to the metal railing and grated floor."], ["Why do the T-1000's clothes remain intact despite the damage done to the terminator during the various battles?", "As shown on the movie, when the T-1000 shifts into new shape it is fully clothed. This would lead to the conclusion that any clothing it might appear to be wearing is also being imitated by its poly-alloy material, thus making it unnecessary for it to acquire any new clothing after being damaged. This does not apply for the T-800 model. As seen in the the first three films in the franchise, the T-800 must find a person who matches his body type and take their clothes (usually by force) and put them on himself. You can spot several bullet holes in the T-800's clothing in the end part of the movie. In T2, when the T-1000 kills the police officer at the beginning, he does not take off the officer's uniform and put it on himself, he simply mimics the image of the uniform with his built in poly-alloy, making the uniform itself nothing more than a part of his body which will heal rapidly. The only thing he takes off the officer is his standard issue Beretta 92FS and the extra ammo from his belt."], ["How were the Terminators after T1 sent back in time if the humans won the war?", "In The Terminator Dr. Silberman asked \"Why didn't this computer just kill Connor then? Why this elaborate scheme with the Terminator?\" and Kyle replied \"It had no choice. Their defense grid was smashed, we'd won, taking out Connor then would make no difference. Skynet would have to wipe out his entire existence.\" Dr. Silberman asked \"Is that where you captured the lab complex and found the, what is it called, the, time displacement equipment?\" and Kyle said \"That's right. The Terminator had already gone through, Connor sent me back to intercept and they blew the whole place.\" The humans had not yet won the war in the future when the Terminators were sent back. They had Skynet \"on the brink,\" but hadn't yet finished it off. One can presume that all of the Terminators were sent back at the same time, each targeted at a specific point in the past. Why Reese only appears to know of the one sent to 1984 is another matter. According to the original Terminator 2 script, after Connor sent back Kyle he went to a cold storage facility where he finds a whole row of 800 seres model 101 Terminators with one missing (the first Terminator), and picks one off the line. This is probably why Kyle didn't know about second Terminator. According to \"The Future War\" the final novel in the trilogy based on T2, Skynet sent back the original Terminator, and the t-100 and a female ( only important to the book, not the T-x). Kyle Reese volunteers on the spot to go back, and then a reprogramed Terminator ( T-800 from part 2) is sent back next. So it may be that Reese is aware and knows Sarah still is skeptical, so he only mentions the current Terminator due to him being the primary danger to the world."], ["If the Terminator is an infiltration unit who can mimic voices, why does it speak with a thick Austrian accent while in America?", "The real-life answer is because that is how the actor 'Arnold Schwarzenegger' (qv) talks. The Terminator universe answer is that Skynet obviously can't have every Terminator they create and send out on infiltration missions looking exactly alike. If they did, people would easily recognize them. Skynet's source for various likenesses are probably from either people they have captured and held in custody, or people they have encountered, killed, and/or fought out in the field. Tissue samples would be taken (for cloning, tissue cultivation, etc), visual images captured, and if possible, voice patterns and sound recorded. In a deleted scene from Terminator 3, Arnold's character is shown to be modeled on a military man, Sgt. William Candy who has a high voice and southern dialect. An official says \"I don't know about the voice,\" followed by another official, with Arnold's voice, who says: \"We can fix it.\" However, this idea is a later rationalization created by an author other than James Cameron and also not a consideration made at the time of the film's production. Also, as the scene was omitted from the final cut, it can not be considered canon. Another problem with this explanation is that it has been established in The Terminator and Terminator Salvation that early Terminators had very obvious rubber skin. While this skin was surely shaped like a human face/body, it was likely similar to a generic rubber mask one might buy in a costume shop, and not intended to look like anyone specific (i.e., Arnold)."], ["Why is the Model 101 sometimes referred to as the T-800 or T-850?", "While T-101 is the official name of it as stated in the film series. Some fans give the following as the explanation: The Series 800 Terminator is a type of Terminator mass produced by Skynet. Individual Terminators within the series are often referred to as T-800s. The Series 800 Terminators were the first in a line of Series 8XX Terminators in various timelines, including the Series 850 terminators. In the first two films, the Terminator's sent back are \"Cyberdyne Systems series 800 model-101.\" I.E. They are from the 800 series, model number 101. The model number referring to the physical appearance (i.e. Arnold), whereas the model 100 or 102 would look different from Arnold. As the future war progressed, Resistance fighters acquired more and more plasma weapons from destroyed battle units, captured factories, and uncovered warehouses. As a result, Skynet decided to harden the Series 800 Terminator against plasma attacks and add new features to aid in the destruction of mankind. The T-850s, from a physical perspective, are very similar to the T-800s, however there are extensive internal modifications in the T-850 line: Upgraded OS and file storage systems (including files on basic human psychology and behavior), toughened endoskeleton (more resistant to plasma weapon attacks), stronger joints and hydraulics, improved power cells (the compact nuclear-energy Iridium cell used by the T-800 were replaced by two hydrogen fuel cells in the Series 850 Terminator providing greater power and longer life), electronic adrenaline system, limited skin regeneration, faster reboot ability, data evaluation and predictive temporal event forecasting being just a few. Thus, the Series 850 Terminator is a far more dangerous threat than its predecessor, the Series 800 Terminator. On the box of the 1st Terminator VHS edition, you can see, in the left lens of the sunglasses, \"CSM101\", which probably stands for \"Cyberdyne Systems Model 101\", which is how the terminator in Pt 2 refers to himself when he rescues John. An important thing to mention, in the Terminator 2 teaser trailer, during the making of the Arnold terminator, the screen reads 800 series model 101. In the T2 deleted scene were Arnold is shut down and restarted, his HUD during the restart reads series 800 model 101 version 2.4. In the T3 extras, Arnold is refered to as an 850 series model 101."], ["Why didn't the large, intact piece of leg from the terminator seen landing on the ground in the factory (at the end of the first film) get taken away along with the arm and chip (seen at Cyberdyne)?", "Either it wasn't noticed and simply discarded as garbage/rubble, or it's an error/plothole on the part of the film makers. It is possible that all of the pieces of the terminator were collected by Cyberdyne for top secret research, but that the arm and the smashed chip were the only pieces worth keeping on display, as they were the pieces being studied. It's also possible that they ran tests, carbon dating; all sorts of things on the other pieces, causing them to be destroyed. But unless it was some sort of rare metal currently unheard of on the periodic table (which wouldn't necessarily make it radioactive), it was likely considered scrap."], ["If the Connors try and stop Skynet, wouldn't this negate John's existence, as well as both the T-800's and T-1000's existence?", "Another headache paradox from the Terminator films. If John sent Kyle Reese back through time to become his father, then John's younger self and Sarah destroyed the building blocks of Skynet, then Skynet was erased from the timeline of the future. Therefore, there would be no reason to send Kyle Reese back in time and he would never meet Sarah and conceive John. In addition, if Skynet was destroyed this would also mean that they never developed any Terminators such as the T-800 and certainly not a more advanced Terminator such as the T-1000 which evidently was not even developed by Skynet until after the war had started. This theory was basically addressed in T3 by way of saying that Judgement Day was inevitable, therefore the events had to happen. However, at the time James Cameron wrote T2, he intended it to be the end of the story. Since it is presently unknown how causality would resolve in the event of time paradoxes, it is conceivable that altering future events might not affect those in the present, even those resulting from recursive cause/effect scenarios."], ["What model is the T-800's shotgun and what ammo does he use for it?", "The T-800's shotgun is a sawn-off Winchester model 1887. He never uses buckshot throughout the entire film, he only uses slugs in his iconic weapon. This is obvious for two reasons - 1) Everytime he shoots the T-1000 with the shotgun it leaves a large singular hole instead of several small buckshot pellet holes. When he shoots the T-1000 at close range in the head with it, it splits it in half as opposed to blowing it into chunks, which buckshot would do. 2) When the T-800 ejects the shells from the shotgun they are blue not red. In the 90's, all slug shells were coloured blue and buckshot coloured red so that people would be able to tell the two apart."], ["Can you really flip-cock a weapon that has a lever loop?", "Yes. In fact, the Winchester 1887 used by the terminator has an enlarged lever loop with a metal plate attached to it specifically made for better handling during flip-cocking. However, filp-cocking is still very tricky and even dangerous if not done correctly. A video with demonstrations and clips from '_The Rifleman_ (qv)' (1958-1963), a 1950s TV series, can be seen here. The flip-cocking the terminator does is an homage to that show, which James Cameron or one or more of his writers might have watched as a kid."], ["Why do we never see T-1000 models on the battlefield fighting the resistance in the opening scene at the beginning of the film, or any future battle sequences seen in any of the other films?", "The T-1000 model played by 'Robert Patrick' (qv) is the only T-1000 model we see in the film. In the opening futuristic battle sequence we see an army of T-800 models as well as several other types of Skynet weaponry, such as aircraft fighters and tank-like machinery, fighting the resistance, but we never see any T-1000s fighting the resistance. There are three possible reasons for this. The first is that the battle sequence we see at the beginning might have been taking place before the T-1000 was ever created. The second is that the T-1000 in the film, while far more advanced, powerful, and durable, was still just a prototype and not ready for mass-production. The third, and most likely reason, is that the T-1000, unlike its predecessor, seems to have a limited emotional range. He is easily able to convince others that he is human: he smiles, can talk in modern day slang (as opposed to the T-800 who stills acts very robotic and uses words like \"affirmative\" and \"negative\" instead of saying yes or no) and conducts himself in the manner of a real police officer. In the clothing store he sees a mannequin that resembles his liquid metal form and seems somewhat surprised by its likeness to him. At the finale of the film, in the factory, Sarah shoots him several times with a shotgun. After he quickly recovers he wags his finger in a \"tsk tsk\" type fashion. Then, in perhaps the best example of his ability to show some emotional range, while torturing Sarah to call John out from hiding, he is thwarted in his interrogation by the T-800 who cuts him in half with a large metal rod. Previously in the film, The T-800 and T-1000 engaged in a small struggle in a mall while perusing John. The T-1000 throws the T-800 through a glass window, then immediately goes back to chasing John without bothering to see if the T-800 was capable of a quick recovery. However, after being stopped by the T-800 yet again, he seems to become extremely frustrated and proceeds to mercilessly beat the T-800, ripping off one of his limbs and impaling him with the metal rod until he is certain that the T-800 has been terminated and will not be able to hinder his objective anymore. He was unsuccessful in doing so, and in another display of an emotion, he exhibits a shocked expression when noticing the T-800 has come back, and after being shot with the grenade launcher which leads to his demise. The final point being that Skynet would not want to mass-produce a model that has the potential of thinking for itself in fear that their own creation might turn against them. Instead, they make a limited number of T-1000s for specific missions only, such as the mission of the T-1000 in this film to kill John Connor."], ["How many different versions exist of this movie?", "Basically three main versions of this movie exist: 1) the Theatrical Version 2) the Special Edition 3) the Ultimate Cut plus there are special cuts in the UK (the T-1000-Edition which is a censored Special Edition version) and the Australian Theatrical Version that is kind of a hybrid a mix out of theatrical version, Special Edition and Ultimate Cut. This cut included the alternate ending of the Ultimate Cut and some scenes of the Special Edition. The dream sequence where Sarah meets Kyle Reese is included while the punishment by the nurses is missing. But back to the basics. In 1993 a Special Edition of Terminator 2 was released that featured more than 15 minutes of new footage. Today this is probably the most common version. Some of the \"new\" scenes are Sarah's dream sequence, the \"learning upgrade\" of the T-800 and several other sequences. In total 18 scenes were added. A detailed comparison between the original Theatrical Version and the Special Edition with pictures can be found here.

Although the heat from the steel mill allows him to melt and regenerate, this incident damaged the T-1000 considerably. He begins to malfunction, first noticing this when his hand begins to meld with a steel bar against his will. He quickly starts losing control of his mimetic processes and begins to inadvertently emulate everything he comes into contact with. He is able to take on Sarah Connor's appearance to try to lure John, but his identity is quickly given away when John notices that his feet meld to the metal flooring, again, against his will. This may also be a factor in why the T-1000 was finally finished off by a grenade fired into his stomach by the T-800, which damaged him to the point of not being able to regenerate fast enough before stumbling into the liquid steel, killing him. As pointed out before, while the T-1000 is technically a superior model, he is still just a prototype, and is possibly not up to date enough to be able to fully recover from an incident like that."], ["How many movies are in the 'Terminator' franchise?", "So far, there are five.

This shell can extend around all of the bullet or often just the front and sides with the rear left as exposed lead. The jacket allows for higher muzzle velocities than bare lead without depositing significant amounts of metal in the bore. It also prevents damage to bores from steel or armor piercing core materials. This bullet type distinguishes itself from hollow point bullets. The symbolic meaning of the term is that the recruits on Parris Island have to go through a rigorous training program to turn them into soldiers capable of following orders without question, surviving in combat and to kill their enemies without having any moral complications about doing so. Also, Joker's time in combat in Vietnam is indicative of this concept: by the end of the film he is a hardened soldier without fear.

It could be either regular scheduled PT or incentive PT which was either individual or group punishment for some minor infraction, or sometimes it would occur if the DI (Drill Instructor) was bored and wanted to play with you.

American soldiers in Vietnam often found out of place objects like the rabbit or small boxes or containers containing what appeared to be important items that were wired to an explosive device like a mine or grenade. The technique was used by the Viet Cong not only to kill American soldiers but also to kill civilians and their children. As a result, soldiers were strictly forbidden by their commanders to touch any strangely out-of-place objects. Craze momentarily forgot that rule, and it cost him his life."], ["How can the door gunner get away with shooting civilians?", "First, the man is obviously crazy; there have been many mentally-imbalanced soldiers in every war that has been fought. Second, In South Vietnam, there were many areas that had been occupied by the enemy for a long period of time. The Americans declared those regions \"free fire zones\"; anything that moved there could be fired upon, including civilians. The door gunner himself explains this: \"Anybody who runs is a VC. Anybody who doesn't run is a well-disciplined VC.\""], ["Was the sniper really \"trying to suck [them] all in one at a time\" like Cowboy suggested?", "Yes. By deliberately and methodically wounding their comrades and making them feel either upset or guilty about their buddies being tortured, the sniper hoped more of them would run into her line of fire, or, all of them at once. What Cowboy suspected was that the sniper might not have been alone and was drawing the squad into an ambush that would get them all killed. However, he was an ineffectual squad commander and Animal Mother and Doc decided to ignore his orders."], ["Were convicts, such as Animal Mother, actually drafted?", "No. You couldn't be drafted into any branch of the military (Army, Marines, Navy, Air Force) if you: had been convicted of a felony; were presently on probation or any kind of parole; had any criminal charges pending. However, judges and prosecutors frequently offered plea deals to lesser criminals before conviction. Basically, the deal was that charges would be dropped if they enlisted in the Armed Forces. If they took the deal, law enforcement officers would often accompany them to the recruiting station, thus ensuring that the contract was inked. (That's how R. Lee Ermey, \"Gunnery Sergeant Hartman\", got into the USMC in real life.) Each U.S. military branch had an Applicant Code for this kind of contract. If they failed to show up for shipping out, the recruiter would notify the authorities. Officially, these kind of deals happened from the early 1950s through the late 1970s. Unofficially, they continued into the 1980s and 1990s. During the Clinton administration, DoD effectively DNQ'd plea bargained contracts. According to rumor, it still happens. Ethically, it is very risky for a recruiter to do such a thing. Fraudulent enlistment is even worse for the recruiter than it is the fraudulent enlistee."], ["What is meant by 'Tet'?", "Tet is the Vietnamese lunar new year and traditionally a time to pay tribute to ancestors, have family reunions, and celebrate prosperity and good fortune. It is considered so important in the Vietnamese culture that, even in the midst of the Vietnam war, the communists and allied forces opposing them would arrange for a truce between and call for a temporary cease to any combat operations. Joker and Rafterman's commanding officer, Lt. Lockhart, makes note of the fact of how important the holiday is to the Vietnamese, calling it the \"Fourth of July, Christmas and New Year's all rolled into one.\" However, the Vietcong and the North Vietnamese Army (NVA) took advantage of the ceasefire and attacked in a large & coordinated offensive all over the south."], ["How accurate is the depiction of the Tet offensive?", "Very. On the evening of January 30, 1968, the Viet Cong, supplemented by the North Vietnamese Army, broke the truce and launched a massive offensive all over South Vietnam, intending for the South Vietnamese population to rise in support of communism. This failed to happen. South Vietnamese intelligence gained advance warning of the attack through captured enemy documents, and the allies were able to largely thwart them, killing the Viet Cong in huge numbers. This film popularized the fallacy that Viet Cong suicide squads overran the US Embassy in Saigon; actually they only occupied part of the garden before being wiped out. (Lt Lockhart's report that the embassy was overrun may have just been incomplete information that he received -- reports took time to assemble and send in the late 60s, even during military operations.) The one major city the VC were able to take was Hue, massacring 2,800-6,000 local civilians whom they dubbed as 'counter revolutionaries' just as depicted in the film (the scene where Joker & Rafterman see the dead bodies in the mass grave illustrates this fact).

'Lubly Fan' beckons a young woman to come out and dance by the light of the moon.

In the alternate reality, however, she is shown as a spinster librarian wearing glasses. They point out that there's really no way that just knowing George could have affected Mary's eyes, so several theories have arisen to explain this conundrum. The most common explanation is that Mary spends so much time reading that she ended up straining her eyes. A mirror theory is that, in George's reality, Mary did not read a lot, so she didn't need glasses. Both theories are based on the idea that reading too much causes one to need glasses, an idea that was prevalent in the 1940s but has since been disproved. Another theory is that Mary needs glasses in both realities but doesn't wear them in George's reality in order to look 'pretty,' because it was a popular belief in the 1940s that 'boys don't make passes at girls who wear glasses.' A third theory is that something happened to Mary's eyes in the alternate reality, e.g., an illness that might not have happened had George been there. The most likely explanation is that the screenwriters were exploiting a common stereotype in 1940s in order to make Mary seem frumpy and unglamorous: that older, unmarried woman all wore glasses and dowdy clothes, had their hair in buns, and grew up to be librarians, teachers, or nurses. They also gave her a rather ungainly way of walking in this scene."], ["How could Zuzu have gotten a cold just by not buttoning up her coat? Aren't colds caused by viruses?", "Yes, they are. Although _It's a Wonderful Life_ (qv) is a classic and is played during every Christmas season, it must be remembered that the movie was made in 1946 when people had a different idea of what caused a cold. Although French chemist Louis Pasteur [1822-1895] discovered germs in 1860, the common cold virus was not known until the 1950s. Until then, it was believed that colds were caused by becoming chilled, such as not wearing a hat or shoes or not buttoning one's coat. If Zuzu was real, her 'cold' would have been contacted a few days before (cold viruses usually take about three days to manifest symptoms) or she might only have gotten a nose run from the cold."]], "0107048": [["A Note Regarding Spoilers", "The following FAQ entries may contain spoilers.

Lauda was angry at the question, and defiant, \"No. No surgery. I don't care how I look. How I look now is how I look. If people don't like the way I look, they don't have to look at me.\"Garrett also references an article following that press conference which was written by a journalist whom he does not identify:Later, I know a British journalist asked in print, \"I wonder if Mrs. Lauda has had any input into that decision.\" Whether this journalist was later introduced to the blunt end of James Hunt's anger, I do not know; but he did not remain on the motorsports beat for long thereafter.It is true that James Hunt had a reputation for a bad temper and for sometimes even striking out at people. After spinning off during the Canadian Grand Prix in 1977, he punched Ernie Strong, a volunteer race marshal who had come to his assistance. Hunt was fined $2,000 for that incident, and Strong later successfully sued him in court."]], "0325980": [["A Note Regarding Spoilers", "The following FAQ entries may contain spoilers.

Second:, Gibbs yearned for a free life and quit the Navy after a few years seeing how tyrannical they were, which inspired him to become a pirate. Third: Gibbs was always secretly a pirate or sympathetic to their cause and simply acted as if against them in order to not be discovered.

In Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest, the now disgraced James Norrington said \"My story is exactly the same as your story, except one chapter behind.\" As we know, Norrington let Jack get a head start on his escape, which eventually lead to Norrington being ejected from the Navy and a warrant issued for his arrest, forcing him to join a pirate crew."]], "0468569": [["A Note Regarding Spoilers", "The following FAQ entries may contain spoilers.

It was originally a stand-in for New York City, but has also resembled other crime-ridden urban centers such as Chicago and Detroit. Some sources, including Mayfair Games' authorized (but now out-of-print) Atlas of the DC Universe, have placed Gotham City in the state of New Jersey. Christopher Nolan's Gotham City is located in the middle of the estuary of the Liberty River, where it empties into the Atlantic Ocean. The river separates most of Gotham from the mainland. The River Merchant divides Uptown from Midtown, while Midtown is separated from Downtown by the Gotham River. The Narrows is a small island in the Gotham River. A creek divides the district of South Hinkley from the rest of Gotham City. Gotham International Airport is in Pettsburg, to the north of the Liberty River estuary. The current DC Universe version of Gotham City is separated from the mainland by the Gotham River, bridged by a series of bridges and tunnels. The east and south sides of Gotham face the Atlantic Ocean. The city is further divided by the Sprang River (named for Dick Sprang) on the northern end and the Finger River (for 'Bill Finger' (qv)) to the south. Tiny Blackgate Isle to the south-east is home to Blackgate Maximum Security Penitentiary. (Blackgate is replaced by Stonegate Penitentiary in the animated series \"_Batman_ (qv)\" (1992) and its spin-offs.) A map of the Gotham City transit lines can be seen here.\n\n_Batman_ (qv) Begins and _The Dark Knight_ (qv) both have scenes that were filmed in Chicago. It has been noted by some sources that people watch these movies just to see what Chicago landmarks they can recognize. Some examples in _The Dark Knight_ (qv) are as follows: the US Post Office entrance on Van Buren Street portrays the Gotham National Bank in the opening robbery. The car chase midway through the movie passes through a number of different environments like Lower Wacker Drive (where most of the action happens), through various parts of the Loop, and even a scene of the Batpod traveling through Millennium Station (you can even see South Shore Line signs). Various scenes in the movie were filmed on South LaSalle Street, including parts of the car chase, the funeral procession scene and the stunt where the semi-truck was flipped -- the large tower at the end of the street is the Chicago Board of Trade. After wrapping in Chicago, the production headed to Hong Kong. \"The filming locations will include the Central-Mid-Levels escalator, some parts of Queen's Road Central and The Centre,\" notes the newspaper The Standard."], ["During the opening bank heist, how did the Joker plan to kill all of his crew?", "The crew and their roles are as follows: Happy (safe), Dopey (alarm), Grumpy (gathers the money in bags), Chuckles (crowd control), the Joker/Bozo (crowd control), and the driver of the school bus. In the film, the order in which they kill each other is: (1) Happy shoots Dopey in the back with a suppressed pistol after Dopey disables the alarm. (2) the bank manager shoots Chuckles in the back with a shotgun, (3) Grumpy shoots Happy in the head once Happy opens the vault, (4) the bus driver runs over Grumpy, and (5) as the bus driver wonders what happened to the other guys, the Joker guns him down with an automatic pistol. The first two went as planned, but assuming the bank manager didn't shoot Chuckles and the bus driver didn't run over Grumpy, it's likely that Chuckles would have killed Grumpy (as Grumpy already shot Happy). Then the bus driver would have killed Chuckles and in the end, the Joker would have still killed the bus driver. However, the Joker is a highly intelligent psychopath, so he is able to plan everything out meticulously. Therefore, the events in the actual robbery may have worked out exactly how he had planned: knowing that the bank was a mob bank, he knew that the manager likely would have had a weapon stashed in his office, so he had Chuckles stand guard with his back to the office so the manager would shoot him. Then he had Grumpy place the money in an area too close to the doorway so the bus would run him over."], ["Was the Joker using a machine pistol in the bank and later during the convoy chase? If so, what is the make and model?", "Yes. The Joker is using a customized selective-fire Glock 18 which is a 9mm handgun with an extended (31 rounds with standard floorplate, 33 with extended, the normal for this magazine is extended) magazine, since the weapon fires full-auto. He uses this handgun in several scenes; it appears to be his gun of choice. The Joker wields this handgun in the bank heist, on the semi trailer in the convoy chase, at the money burning pile, and in the hospital (it is attached with a silencer in this scene). The gun the Joker uses in the convoy chase scene, when he gets out of the truck yelling \"Hit me!\", is a Smith & Wesson M76 Submachine gun with a swivel stock that is folded to one side. Source."], ["What's the deal with all the Batmen?", "There is only one real _Batman_ (qv). The other ones are a gang of vigilantes who are inspired by _Batman_ (qv), which is why they wear goalie pads and use guns instead of gadgets. When the Joker is trying to draw _Batman_ (qv) out, he starts killing these would-be followers of the Dark Knight. These impostor \"Batmen\" were likely inspired by the \"Sons of the _Batman_ (qv)\" vigilante gang as featured in Frank Miller's graphic novel, '_The Dark Knight_ (qv) Returns'. A similar group called the \"Batboys\" appears in Miller's sequel, '_The Dark Knight_ (qv) Strikes Again'."], ["How did the Joker come to be 'the joker'?", "In The Killing Joke, a one-shot comic written by Alan Moore and drawn by Brian Bolland (released in 1988) the Joker is revealed to be a former engineer at a chemical plant who quit his job to pursue his dream of being a stand-up comedian. However, he was literally booed offstage after only one show and was left desperate to support his pregnant wife. He agreed to help a group of local crooks rob the chemical plant, but tried to back out after his wife was killed in a household accident. The crooks insisted, and made him wear a red mask, impersonating a well-known villain called Red Hood, so that if the police turned up, he would appear to be the ringleader. When, as predicted, both the police and _Batman_ (qv) intervened, the engineer jumped into a vat of chemicals to escape, bleaching his skin white, dying his hair green and damaging the nerve endings in his face, resulting in a permanent, hideous grin. The pain and trauma he had gone through in just one day resulted in his going utterly insane, hence the Joker's belief that it only takes one bad day \"to drive the sanest man alive to lunacy.\" However, this is all open to interpretation. The Joker himself fully admits that he's lied about it so often, even he isn't sure what truly happened.\n\nIn this film, it's made clear that a freak accident hasn't made him look like a clown. He wears make-up (Happy and Dopey's conversation at the beginning while breaking open the control panel on the roof offers proof), and we can see the makeup change throughout the movie as he sweats. In the scene where he fires at the mayor while disguised as a member of the honor guard, we see him without his makeup line. As for his scars, the Joker gives two conflicting explanations for them. One version, which he tells to Gambol before killing him, is that his father slashed his cheeks open as a child after he (the Joker) took his father performing the same act on his mother \"too seriously.\" Later, when the Joker and his henchmen crash Dent's fundraiser, he claims to Rachel that his wife was scarred by the loan sharks and that he cut his own cheeks with a razor blade to prove to her that scars did not matter. He starts to tell _Batman_ (qv) a third story about how he might have been disfigured before _Batman_ (qv) interrupts him. It is very possible that none of these statements are true. The ambiguity adds to the mystique of the Joker as a nobody who comes from nowhere; and it keeps the audience guessing."], ["How is the pencil trick possible?", "The pencil penetrated through one of the thug's eyes (although this is not explicitly shown), as the vulnerable eye is the only possible \"point of entry\" for the pencil to make an instant kill. Death would result from either the force of the eyeball, the pencil, or both breaking the bone directly behind the eye socket and forcing it into the brain; alternatively, the pencil itself could have penetrated straight through to the brain. Then again, for moviegoers who can't suspend their disbelief, the pencil itself could have been one of the Joker's deadly props. The Joker, throughout the character's history, has always had a supply of normally harmless items turned deadly, such as playing cards that are razor-sharp and flowers that squirt acid. The present Joker proves to have the same fondness for malicious gadgets right from the beginning, when he sticks a gas grenade in the bank manager's mouth. This seems especially plausible given that an ordinary pencil could not be jammed into a table, as the Joker does, without the pencil breaking and thus no longer able to stand up for the Joker's \"trick\"."], ["Why is there a new Batsuit?", "The suit was changed both for story and production reasons. During the production of _Batman_ (qv) Begins, 'Christian Bale' (qv) and the stunt men were constantly in danger of overheating because of the dense nature of the foam latex used to create the suit. It was also difficult for Bale to move, rotate, or to show expression in the head and neck area. Bale also complained that the original suit gave him a crushing headache every time he put the suit on. The suit also damaged easily. The new suit is made of polyurethane; it's a lot cooler and more durable, despite the increase of eight pounds. In the movie, Bruce Wayne asks Lucius for a new suit that will allow him to turn his head (which, he comments, will make it easier to back out of the driveway) and also protect him from dogs (referring to a prior attack). Lucius warns that increased agility means an increased vulnerability to bullets and knives because the plates that make up the suit have gaps in between."], ["Is there a new Bat Vehicle?", "Yes. _Batman_ (qv) has a new vehicle called a Batpod, which is a re-imagining of the Batcycle (_Batman_ (qv)'s motorcycle from previous incarnations). Within the film it is actually a separate unit that detaches from the front end of the Tumbler (the Batmobile) after that vehicle is catastrophically damaged by an RPG (rocket-propelled grenade) fired at close range by the Joker."], ["How does Bruce get a penthouse connected to a secret garage?", "The secret garage is not connected to the penthouse. Instead it's located underneath a shipping dock owned by Wayne Enterprises. Even though it's not a canon part of the Nolanverse, Louise Simonson's novelization of the animated _Batman_ (qv): Gotham Knight provides a reasonable explanation of how Bruce was able to modify his penthouse apartment in _The Dark Knight_ (qv) (boldface added for emphasis): Despite a recent effort by an ex-CEO to take the company public while Bruce was out of the country and presumed missing, Bruce had managed to buy up the majority of the stock. He continued to own the controlling shares in Wayne Enterprises, which had given him a great deal of leeway when it came to remodeling the corporate headquarters.\n\nThe Wayne Enterprises building took up an entire city block. It rose in art-deco splendor into the skies of Gotham, just as splendid, in its way, as the taller Aparo Tower. It was one of Gotham's indespensable hubs of financial power and a vital center for public transportation.

What happened?", "Two of Gambol's men place the Joker's body on the pool table. The other three were escorting the men who supposedly 'killed' the Joker. When the Joker jumps up from the table, we see him reach out with both arms, obviously killing the two men who put him on the table by stabbing them. This then raises the question as to how he stabbed both of them and managed to get a perfectly clean knife up to Gambol's mouth. But let's not forget that the Joker carries multiple knives at all times and that he is very fast, as he managed to get the upper hand on _Batman_ (qv) twice in the film."], ["What does the Joker mean by \"try-outs?\"", "The Joker explains that he will let one of the three remaining thugs from Gambol's gang join his gang. \"So,\" he explains, \"we're going to have ... try-outs.\" He breaks the pool cue in half, looks at the now sharp end of one half, and drops it between the three men. \"Make it fast,\" he says, as he leaves the room. Gambol's men are shoved to the ground, and as they recover, they all look at the broken cue, then at each other. He who is the first to grab the pool cue and kill the other two gets to work for the Joker. While later scenes give no additional insight into what happens off-screen, it's generally accepted that the term \"try-outs\" when used in most contexts (eg. baseball tryouts, etc.) refers to testing the abilities of an individual as relates to the goal they are seeking (or in this case, having forced upon them)."], ["How exactly did Gambol die from the Joker's knife?", "The Joker has his blade in Gambol's mouth, threatening to cut his cheeks. And presumably he does, off camera. There is a belief among some fans that you can't die from having your cheek slashed, but it is possible; laceration of the face was listed as a cause of death in the infamous Black Dahlia murder. The shock and blood loss could cause death. It's also possible that the Joker got carried away and went beyond cutting Gambol's cheeks. Since the murder happened off camera, we don't know.\n\nOn the other hand some suggested that Gambol did not die at all. Since the action is off screen, Gambol might be playing dead to hide from the Joker's and the thugs' attention after being cut at the mouth/ cheek."], ["Why is the Mayor of Gotham City wearing eyeliner?", "'Nestor Carbonell' (qv)'s eyelashes are naturally thick and dark.

If you listen, you can hear a mechanical noise as _Batman_ (qv) bends the barrel of the gun. He also uses this same device on Scarecrow's van. He tries to rip a hole in the side in an attempt to apprehend the villain. After the device jams, _Batman_ (qv) is slammed into a wall and Scarecrow almost escapes. _Batman_ (qv) then jumps onto his van from a few stories up, and crushes it.

Because he is holding Rachel, he breaks her fall, too."], ["What was the purpose of each step in the bullet/fingerprint analysis?", "Step by step: (1) _Batman_ (qv) takes a piece of concrete containing all the pieces of the shattered bullet since that is what he will need at the end. (2) The gunshots were to test different bullet types in hopes of finding what type of bullet was used by matching the hole size made in the concrete and the wave patterns between the two blocks of concrete through sonar. (3) Once the bullet type was determined, Fox's new type of sonar imaging was used in visualizing the bullet fragments and allowing them to be recombined to match the known bullet type. Why the image could be gathered at the new Batcave but only be pieced together at Wayne Enterprises is unclear; it is a plot point which allows the sonar device to resonate an image of a fingerprint since the oil found on someone's skin would not be picked up that easily (or clearly) by a soundwave. (4) The fingerprint is matched to all possible suspects who have their fingerprints on file. (5) Of the four, the one they chose (Melvin White) had a known address which was on the procession route for the funeral march."], ["Who is Melvin White?", "Melvin White, at the time of discovery, is assumed to be the real name of the Joker (since Wayne thinks that the Joker is the one who loaded the bullet), but White turns out to only be one of the Joker's assassins. Wayne goes to White's apartment, where the Joker has set up the trap. It is unclear how the Joker would know that _Batman_ (qv) would a) take over a crime scene from police in order to collect evidence, b) specifically focus on a bullet, c) somehow have the technology to recombine a representation of the bullet and the fingerprint on it, d) know that of the four fingerprints found, the one belonging to Melvin White would be the one presumed to be him, and e) have the discovery of the apartment so perfectly timed that _Batman_ (qv) would enter the apartment at the exact time a certain timer would go off. However, it's possible that _Batman_ (qv)'s discovery of the apartment, as well as all other evidence, was not part of the Joker's plan at all, since _Batman_ (qv) would have thwarted the assassination plot if he had discovered the hostages sooner. It appears that _Batman_ (qv) discovers the apartment too late and simply arrives in time to witness the chain of events set in motion by the Joker. The egg timer, the window shade, and the scope were likely a diversion for the snipers, giving the Joker an opportunity to assassinate the mayor. (This seems the more likely explanation, as the Joker well knows that the _Batman_ (qv) comes out at night only, and not during the day - this is alluded to in his scene with the mob meeting.)"], ["Why does Gordon take off the Joker's handcuffs?", "Gordon most likely knew exactly what was going to happen when letting _Batman_ (qv) take over the interrogation. He probably thought it would be seen as too unfair to have Joker handcuffed while _Batman_ (qv) beats on him. Besides, it is common (at least in movies) when a prisoner is in an interrogation room to remove the handcuffs. The prisoner is in a securely locked room. The gesture is meant to relax him and give him the impression that the police officer is doing him a kindness (which is why Joker assumed it was part of the \"good cop/bad cop\" routine - Gordon's line about going to \"get some coffee\" is a classic representation of the concept)."], ["What exactly is _Batman_ (qv)'s \"One Rule\"?", "_Batman_ (qv)'s one rule is that he will not be an executioner. The explanation to this is found in _Batman_ (qv) Begins - when Bruce chooses not to kill a criminal, and instead sets fire to the home of the League of Shadows. Bruce states to Ra's al Ghul, \"I will not be an executioner;\" even if the act of setting the fire might itself have led to one or more deaths (he himself even believes he has killed Ra's), it is not a deliberate act of murder. He does not violate this rule in _Batman_ (qv) Begins - he says it in a different way when he says he doesn't have to save Ra's al-Ghul. He leaves it up to al Ghul to get out of the doomed train himself. He may or may not have caused deaths in Dark Knight; for example, _Batman_ (qv) rams the Batmobile into the garbage truck that one of the Joker's men was driving, which caused it to be pancaked into the ceiling of the tunnel. There's an extremely high chance the driver of that vehicle was killed. Also, _Batman_ (qv) flips over the Joker's transport truck that he and his henchmen were riding in, which very well could have and might have killed some of them. None of these would be considered \"executions\" in _Batman_ (qv)'s view - _Batman_ (qv)'s intent was not to kill Joker or his men, but to stop the truck from reaching Dent. By contrast, _Batman_ (qv) does not mow down the Joker in the street immediately afterward. Had he done so, he would have had the clear intent of killing the Joker - an execution.\n\nLikewise, _Batman_ (qv) does not intend to \"execute\" Harvey Dent - he intends to prevent the death of Gordon's son, and in the process, knocks Dent off the side of the building. From this perspective, then, _Batman_ (qv) does not violate his one rule at any time, even if the situations in the film present a very fine line between \"execution\" versus \"killed incidentally.\"\n\nIn _Batman_ (qv)'s line of work, collateral damage caused by his enemies or himself are almost assured. So if _Batman_ (qv)'s one rule was simply \"I don't kill people,\" then he'd have to be significantly more timid and by extension, less effective in his actions to stop criminals. The majority of his actions in these films could very well lead to people dying, even if it wasn't his direct intention. For example, _Batman_ (qv) throws Maroni off a building from about 3 stories up. _Batman_ (qv) was \"counting on\" the fall not killing Maroni, but people have died from much shorter falls."], ["Why was Stephens guarding the door from the inside of the interrogation room rather than from the outside?", "It's likely because they wanted eyes on The Joker at all times. There didn't appear to be any cameras inside the interrogation room (just the two-way mirror that was smashed). It's also possible they didn't want him to escape through the broken mirror."], ["How does the Joker plan to escape the interrogation room if he had no one to talk to inside it?", "Since the room isn't soundproof, the Joker could have simply lured someone to him by making a ruckus (like trying to break the glass, for example) and start talking to whomever is on the other side of the window. Not to mention, with shards of broken glass everywhere, there was a much higher risk of him possibly harming himself, which the Joker clearly isn't afraid to do, given the smile on his face."], ["Where does the Joker get the knife that he uses to take Stephens hostage?", "It wasn't a knife. It was a piece of glass from the two-way mirror that broke when _Batman_ (qv) slammed the Joker's head into it. This can clearly be seen in either the IMAX theater or the Blu-Ray disc. It's far too large to be concealed in a shoe, and it has an extremely reflective surface facing out."], ["Was Detective Stephens corrupt?", "No. Out of Gordon's unit, he was the only one Gordon truly trusted. Stephens was the one who checked the vitals on Gordon after he was shot by the Joker. Therefore, he knew Gordon wasn't dead. If he were corrupt, he likely would have told Maroni that Gordon's death was faked. Gordon also trusted Stephens to guard the Joker in the interrogation room. But Stephens let his temper get the better of him, and the Joker was able to take him hostage to escape."], ["Did Detective Stephens die?", "No. He is seen later on in the film, with a bandage on his neck, watching the news beside Gordon as Joker makes his threat to blow up a hospital. Stephens also appears when Gordon destroys the Bat-Signal."], ["How could the Joker time the bombs so perfectly to ensure that the police cannot save either Harvey or Rachel without knowing exactly when _Batman_ (qv) is going to interrogate him?", "It's possible that the bombs were remotely activated only after _Batman_ (qv) and the cops were seen rushing out of the MCU. Hence, the Joker's claims about having \"only minutes left\" may have been instructions to his men to detonate both bombs if they didn't see _Batman_ (qv) and/or the police rapidly leaving the building by a certain time. Also, they may have been told to detonate the bomb for whichever building the police arrived at, before they entered. The timers on the bombs may have just been a fail-safe, had _Batman_ (qv) tried to locate and neutralize any spotters, he wouldn't have had time to rescue whichever target he went after.\n\nIt's also possible that the Joker didn't truly know that it wasn't possible for the police to rescue the other hostage, but was simply intending to make _Batman_ (qv) have to choose to only rescue one of them personally. Given the abilities of _Batman_ (qv)'s vehicles, it wouldn't be unreasonable for him to assume that _Batman_ (qv) would make better time than the police, and thus waited to reveal his hand until after it was likely that no police cars could make either location in sufficient time."], ["How does Two-Face come to be 'two-face'?", "Harvey Dent is kidnapped and tied up. He falls over while trying to escape, which knocks over a gas barrel, spilling its contents and splashing some on his face. As _Batman_ (qv) saves Dent from the building rigged by the Joker, it explodes. Both narrowly escape, but Dent is burned as fire shoots out from the explosion and ignites the fuel. In the hospital, Dent demands that Gordon say the nickname given to him (Dent) when he was working with Internal Affairs. Gordon replies \"Two-Face.\" Dent adopts the nickname as his own.\n\nThe comics have a different origin for Harvey Dent. Dent gives testimony in court against a mobster named Salvatore Maroni, who appears in this movie. Maroni tosses a bottle of acid at Dent's face. _Batman_ (qv) comes in to prevent the throw, but he only succeeds in saving half of Harvey's face. Dent later steals Maroni's good luck coin, and uses it to decide if he will be good or evil. This was depicted in the original Detective Comics. The Jeph Loeb/Tim Sale graphic novel, _Batman_ (qv): The Long Halloween, has a slight variation. Maroni still scars Dent, but Sal has help from a corrupt assistant DA. He manages to smuggle the acid in a bottle he claims contains antacids to treat a nonexistent stomach ulcer. Harvey inherits the coin from his abusive father (In the film, Harvey's coin also comes from his father, but there's no mention of whether he was abusive.) In the film, Maroni still attempts to have Dent killed in the courtroom, but employs a (ultimately defective) gun instead of the acid; this was possibly included as a nod to the original comic version."], ["Could a person's face burn like that and survive?", "Not exactly. While the film tries to keep the characters relatively realistic, it still requires us to suspend our disbelief. The left side of Dent's face is soaked in diesel fuel, which is ignited, completely burning and charring the skin on the left side of his face. His left eyelid is completely burned away as well as most of his cheek, exposing his jaw muscles and the inside of his mouth. This is the unrealistic part: burns that deep would need more prolonged exposure to heat than what would be provided by a thin layer of accelerant on the skin, especially given the fact that _Batman_ (qv) was present to pat out the flames. While there are no vital arteries to be destroyed, he would be in an unimaginable amount of pain. Given the pain, grief and trauma Harvey suffers, it's not difficult to imagine him going insane. Harvey's internal battle, as depicted in the comic books, is the battle between his evil, revenge-driven half and his sane, compassionate half, hence his new name, Two-Face.\n\nWhile a person could reasonably survive the burning, it is worth noting that it is not possible to leave the muscles and eyeballs exposed without the tissue becoming highly infected and necrotic (dying). Immediate surgery and skin would have been required. Harvey also makes facial expressions that are not possible, since his muscles are so badly damaged. It's also not possible for him to speak as clearly as he does, since half his lips and cheek are missing. Moreover, third degree burn victims are also highly susceptible to infection. They are kept in \"burn units\" in hospitals where the air they're surrounded with can be controlled. Nevertheless, it's not difficult to suspend our disbelief for the character, especially when he exists in a comic book fantasy. Many viewers put down his survival and ability to function to an adrenaline rush. It's also worth noting that the character does not live for very long after the accident, so his ability to survive in the long term need never be a problem in terms of realism. Dent even says \"You think I want to escape from this?\" then gestures to his burnt face and says \"There is no escape from *this*!\". So it seems that Dent knew he was a dead man by leaving the hospital and simply wanted vengeance before his passing."], ["How does the Joker get half of the mob's money when he hasn't even killed _Batman_ (qv)?", "The Joker has himself arrested so as to get to Lau and discover the location of the money. After doing so, he has all the money and is therefore in a strong position to demand his fee."], ["If the Joker is 'a man of his word' as he keeps claiming, why does he keep screwing people over?", "The Joker has a twisted set of principles. He will twist his words so people will believe him, but the result will not favor anyone but him. He deceives the mob because he is disgusted by how they only care about money and not the chaos and anarchy he loves so dearly. For example, he finds the money as he promised the mob he would. Then he sets fire to \"his half.\" However, given the fact that all the money is piled together, the rest of it would burn as well. He told _Batman_ (qv) where both Rachel and Harvey were being held hostage as he said he would, but he switched the addresses. He tells Dent that the kidnapping was 'nothing personal' and we later find out that it was the Joker's intention to lead Dent specifically to insanity."], ["What model was the Lamborghini that Bruce Wayne drove?", "2008 Euro-Spec Lamborghini Murci\u00e9lago LP 640.

The name Murci\u00e9lago (pronounced moor-thee-EH-la-goh in traditional Castilian Spanish and moor-see-EH-la-goh in Spanish of Latin America), means \"bat\" in Spanish."], ["How many screens does _Batman_ (qv)'s \"high-frequency generator-receiver\" (cell phone scanner) have?", "It has eight rows and 48 columns making a total of 384 screens."], ["How did _Batman_ (qv) equip every cell phone in Gotham with the sonar technology?", "Bruce Wayne indicates to Lucius Fox that he has budgeted a large amount of money to a government telecommunications project. When Lucius asks, Bruce indicates that he is \"playing this one pretty close to his chest.\" The audience can only assume that this was all part of a plan that Bruce had, knowing the technology would come in handy against the Joker. (Later in the film, it becomes clear why Bruce did not tell Lucius, who is upset by _Batman_ (qv)'s spying.) It is not known exactly how _Batman_ (qv) equipped every cell phone in Gotham with sonar technology. It is simply presented as possible, in order to advance the plot. In order to assimilate or approximate a three-dimensional space, sound waves must come in consistent stereo pairs; cell phones have a single speaker for resonating sound and a single microphone for receiving sound. Further, in order to process sound differently than they are equipped, the cell phones would need to have both their hardware and software upgraded. It is highly improbable that Bruce, even with a government telecommunications project, would be able to forcibly upgrade the cell phones of every resident in Gotham simultaneously without a single person noticing. Therefore, we can assume that it was a gradual process that Wayne started as soon as he realized the implications of the sonar technology. He could have simply provided the upgraded phones to Gotham citizens purchasing new phones. After all, we usually upgrade our cellphones every two years. Over a period of months or even weeks, a significant number of Gotham citizens would have them. If the cell phone was a significant technological advance, people would have been lining up to buy new ones regardless of the age of their current phone. Just look what happened when the iPhone was made available.\n\nAnother strong possibility is that the project had nothing to do with new phones, merely new phone software. As anyone who buys a cell-phone knows, you can easily download software applications to your phone; the phone company that carries your service also can download software to your phone, and in fact does so when initializing a phone for activation. Wayne's project may have been software that was distributed to cell phone users across Gotham, and designed so that it would not be known to the phone users that new software had been installed. This explanation makes sense in context - Lucius states that Wayne has \"converted\" every phone in the city - not replaced the phones with new ones. And _Batman_ (qv) relies on the Joker using a cell phone that would send a signal - which would only make sense if _Batman_ (qv) had distributed software to every known number in the city, and not had to rely on the Joker buying a new phone."], ["Is that 'Cillian Murphy' (qv) as a security guard in the prisoners' ferry at the end of the film?", "No; it looks like him, but it's a different actor. It is also not Thomas Schiff, the schizophrenic Harvey Dent threatens to kill earlier in the movie. It's just a random actor who is given a quick close up."], ["How did the Joker manage to get the upper hand on a trained ninja like _Batman_ (qv) in two different fights?", "In the first fight, in Bruce Wayne's penthouse, _Batman_ (qv) was fighting multiple opponents at once. The Joker stood back and observed the best time and position from which to attack. Still, he didn't exactly get the upper hand on _Batman_ (qv). In the final fight at the end of the movie, the Joker sends Rottweilers to attack _Batman_ (qv). While _Batman_ (qv) is trying to fend off the dogs, the Joker starts frantically beating him with a pipe. This causes _Batman_ (qv)'s SONAR to malfunction, leaving him blinded and open to attack."], ["Why did _Batman_ (qv) save the Joker in \"_The Dark Knight_ (qv)\" and not save Ra's al Ghul in \"_Batman_ (qv) Begins?\"", "Ra's al Ghul was responsible for being on the monorail and he also is the one who destroyed the controls in the belief that _Batman_ (qv) was trying to stop the train, when in fact, destroying the controls actually aided _Batman_ (qv) in his plan. _Batman_ (qv) threw the Joker off of the building himself. In the first case, Ra's put himself in the situation which resulted in his death, whereas in the second case, had _Batman_ (qv) not saved the Joker, he would be solely responsible for murdering him. Doing so would have been a violation of his one rule, \"I will not be an executioner.\" It is also possible that _Batman_ (qv) was trying to prove to the Joker that he was incorruptible. The Joker even makes it a point after _Batman_ (qv) saves him to say \"You truly are incorruptible.\""], ["When Gordon says, \"Five dead,\" what five is he referring to?", "Gordon says, \"Five dead, two of them cops.\" A definitive answer is impossible. Christopher Nolan, when asked about an answer during a Blu-Ray Live Event, responded \"I will answer this question one day. But not today.\" Here is a list of who he could have meant:\n\nThe cops guarding Harvey Dent at Gotham General Hospital. One cop radios a second cop, who is guarding Dent's room. The guard cop does not reply, so the first cop goes in to check out the situation. The Joker shoots him and presumably has already shot the guard. That's two cops right there and it's possible that Gordon assumed that Two-Face killed them when he left the hospital not realizing it was The Joker.\n\nDetective Wuertz. Killed in the bar.\n\nDetective Anna Ramirez. While Two-Face lets her live, he knocks her out. She would have been missing. Gordon, knowing she's the one who drove Rachel, might have assumed she was dead. Or, less likely, Dent inadvertently killed her - although he intends to let her live, she could have been severely injured (e.g., head striking pavement) after being knocked out by Dent, and subsequently died.\n\nMaroni's bodyguard. As soon as Maroni walks out of the building, and then walks around to get in the passenger side of his car, look to the left of the screen on the driver's side of the car. The bodyguard standing there is grabbed and pulled off-screen. (It's very fast and very quiet so don't take your eye off that guy.)\n\nMaroni's Driver. Shot by Two-Face while driving along the scrapyard.\n\nSalvatore Maroni. Not certain. Two-Face flips his coin and spares Maroni's life. He flips his coin again and tells Maroni that his driver isn't as lucky as he is. Two-Face puts his seat belt on and shoots the driver, causing him to crash and flip the car. While Two-Face walks away from the crash unscathed, we never find out what happened to Maroni. We can assume he was either killed in the crash because he wasn't wearing his seat belt or left Gotham and went into hiding afterwards; either way, he isn't in _The Dark Knight_ (qv) Rises\n\nHarvey Dent. Gordon could have meant Dent himself, because in _The Dark Knight_ (qv) Rises the public is under the impression that _Batman_ (qv) murdered Harvey Dent in cold blood. It is never mentioned who else that _Batman_ (qv) had supposedly killed.\n\nBartender. A far-fetched theory, but here it is. When Two-Face went into the bar to kill Wuertz, the bartender went to the bathroom. Seconds later, we hear Two-Face walk out of the bathroom. Two-Face might have also killed the bartender to get rid of a witness. Note that Two-Face always obeys the flip of his coin no matter who the person is or what they might have done wrong. If this did happen, the reasons the scene might have been cut are: it was too violent for a PG-13 film; it was too early for Two-Face to kill an innocent person (it would have been his first murder); Christopher Nolan wanted him to be a tragic character and therefore wanted to focus on him taking revenge on the people who ruined his life, rather than on him killing an innocent bystander.\n\nCop guarding Gordon's apartment. Also a bit far-fetched, but when forced to call Barbara Gordon, Ramirez refers to cops that are guarding the Gordons, and tells Barbara that they're not to be trusted. After letting Ramirez off, Dent might have killed them in order to ensure that they didn't stop the Gordons from leaving. Note that during the phone call, Ramirez stated that she could distract the cops long enough for the Gordons to leave - but Dent then strikes her and presumably knocks her unconscious. If so, then Gordon is not referring to Wuertz - implying that Gordon did not know Wuertz had been killed.\n\nHowever, since Gordon was in the observation room during the interrogation scene, where the Joker told _Batman_ (qv) \"You didn't disappoint; you let five people die,\" fans could argue it could be the five people the Joker killed: (1) Brian Douglas, \"a Son of _Batman_ (qv), \" (2) Judge Surrillo, the judge presiding over the mob trail, (3) Commissioner Loeb, the man in charge of Gotham P.D., (4) Patrick Harvey, Gotham police officer, and (5) Richard Dent. The flaw in this argument, as far as comparing this to Gordon's final statement to _Batman_ (qv) after Dent's death, is that it's a matter of record that the Joker killed these other people or had them killed in league with Maroni, and _Batman_ (qv)'s \"letting\" them die was simply a matter of _Batman_ (qv) not turning himself in and revealing his true identity, at which point the Joker would have retreated (though Rachel thinks not). Gordon is referring to people who have died after Dent's disappearance, and whose deaths might be traced to Dent. And remember that by that time, Rachel was already dead, which would have upped the Joker's death count to six. Another possibility is that the deaths were off-screen in some way. The Joker says that he wanted to see what _Batman_ (qv) would do, AFTER putting out his ultimatum to turn in his mask, or \"people will die\". So, the five deaths in question would be those that took place after this happens. At this point of the story, the five dead, then, would be five of the police who were escorting Dent to the County Jail. The two guys in the helicopter, the cop the Joker shot in the face from his truck, and presumably two more from the chase scene (likely the two in the car he shot with the RPG). The Joker says that _Batman_ (qv) let these people die because he didn't really turn himself in, and the Joker knew it. This would also explain how all the dead would be friends to the police."], ["How does the Joker manage to get so much done so quickly?", "The obvious answer is that he had been spending the last six months (since the ending of _Batman_ (qv) Begins) carefully planning out everything so that he would be ready. For example, the Joker blows up a hospital. Most likely, he had set the explosives in place long before. This is a trait very typical of the comic book Joker -- he's able to prepare a crime for a long time and yet carry it out before anyone realizes what he's up to. He then \"predicts\" a crime that has already been committed. Another possibility, since Maroni's (and the mob's) goals mesh well with the Joker's social experiments, is that he gets a considerable amount of assistance from the mob after the Chechen puts out the word that he should be hired to get rid of _Batman_ (qv)."], ["How does the movie end?", "Two-Face threatens to kill Commissioner Gordon's son, James Jr ('Nathan Gamble' (qv)), while forcing Gordon to assure his son that everything is going to be all right, just as Dent had to do the same for Rachel while knowing it wasn't. Suddenly, _Batman_ (qv) appears and tries to talk him out of it, explaining that the Joker chose Dent in order to prove that even the best of men could fall. Two-Face shoots _Batman_ (qv), who falls to the floor, then turns his gun on James Jr. Suddenly, _Batman_ (qv) wooshes up, grabs James Jr., and knocks Two-Face over the edge of the building. The fall kills Two-Face and causes _Batman_ (qv) to fall, too. Gordon rushes down to see if _Batman_ (qv) is all right. As he picks himself off the ground, _Batman_ (qv) tells Gordon that the Joker cannot win and offers to take upon himself the responsibility for the five people ('two of them cops') that Two-Face killed. _Batman_ (qv) then flees from the scene. Flash-forwards are shown of Gordon praising Dent at a memorial service, Lucius erasing the cell phone grid, Alfred burning Rachel's letter to Bruce, and Gordon smashing the Bat-Signal. The final scene returns to Gordon and his son standing over Two-Face's body. James Jr asks his father why _Batman_ (qv) is running away, because he didn't do anything wrong, and Gordon replies: 'Because we have to chase him...He's the hero Gotham deserves but not the one it needs right now. So, we'll hunt him because he can take it...because he's not our hero. He's a silent guardian, a watchful protector, a dark knight.'"], ["Why pin Two-Face's crimes on _Batman_ (qv)?", "A number of reasons:\n\n1) When Dent had Gordon's family at the place where Rachel died, the police had a border already set up. By this time, Joker was in custody. Had they blamed Joker, everyone would have known they were lying. That would prompt an investigation into the other deaths. _Batman_ (qv) and Gordon wanted to preserve Dent's image as the \"White Knight,\" giving the citizens of Gotham hope.\n\n2) _Batman_ (qv) wouldn't want to falsely pin crimes on even someone like the Joker.\n\n3) After the events of _The Dark Knight_ (qv), _Batman_ (qv) can no longer allow himself to be affiliated with Gotham Police without risking more deaths. By \"rebranding\" himself, he not only severs all ties to authority, he is also \"becoming the villain.\" As Dent is allowed to die a hero, _Batman_ (qv) must accept the opposite responsibility. (i.e.- Dent's phrase, \"You either die a hero or live long enough to see yourself become the villain.\")\n\n4) Harvey Dent is a leading prosecutor. If word was to get out that he's a crazy killer, all the crime bosses in prison would have sufficient grounds for appeal. All the convictions of all the cases Dent has ever tried could be overturned, and all the crime bosses would be back on the street. The movie mentions this a few times. In their first meeting, the mayor cautioned Dent that he had better watch himself, because all they need is a little dirt on him and all the cases would crumble. During the scene where Dent threatens the fake honor guard who was actually a paranoid schizophrenic, _Batman_ (qv) warns Dent that killing him would put all the cases in jeopardy. _Batman_ (qv) reiterates this to Gordon at the end.\n\n5) During their final confrontation, the Joker explains that _Batman_ (qv)'s weakness is his adherence to rules. Why abide by a code when your enemies obviously don't? Pinning Two-Face's crimes on _Batman_ (qv) is sending a message to the public, and it's not a terribly positive one. This also plays into his psychological dilemma evidenced by the line \"I've seen what I have to become to stop men like him.\" (Another possible interpretation in this vein is referenced earlier in the film. The point is made that the criminals are not scared of _Batman_ (qv) because they know he won't kill, making him less effective. By pinning Two-Faces crimes on _Batman_ (qv), it changes that perception, striking even more fear into the criminal mind.)\n\n6) Giving _Batman_ (qv) a villainous public image should prevent any further copycat batmen harming themselves and others\n\n7) Since he began his fight on crime, _Batman_ (qv) has, inadvertently, become the glue that holds Gotham together. Alfred tells Bruce after the Joker shows up that he can't quit, and that he would have Bruce endure because he can make the choices no one else can make. The decision to take the fall for Harvey was the only way to keep the crime bosses/criminals from being released from jail and to keep the city inspired. The personification of _Batman_ (qv) is the only image/symbol strong enough for Gordon to use, which could convince the people of Gotham to believe the story that _Batman_ (qv), not Harvey, was responsible for those deaths. It would not have been very convincing or ethical to blame those crimes on another person/criminal. This was Bruce/_Batman_ (qv)'s way to be whatever Gotham needed him to be."], ["Why did the Joker turn Harvey Dent into Two-Face?", "Harvey Dent's role in the film is to be presented as 'the perfect guy' (or rather, \"Gotham's White Knight\"). He is an honest person bent on fighting corruption to make a better future for everyone, and was trusted by _Batman_ (qv), the Mayor, and Gordon, as well as earning some affection from Rachel. This 'perfect' person is used by the Joker to make a point to Gotham. With all of the people's spirit based on Harvey as their saviour from the climate of fear created by the Mob, his corruption would make \"their spirit break completely\", which is the Joker's prime intention. He knew that _Batman_ (qv) would go after Rachel when given the choice, so switches the addresses, and Harvey is pulled out of a building alive, with the one he loves dying instead. The Joker then visits him in the hospital to shift the blame off himself, and leaves Dent to descend into insanity, killing cops and, later, innocent people. As is seen throughout the film (those most explicitly in the ferry scene), the Joker wants to turn good people into bad people, to make 'fair' chaos. By taking 'the best of us' and '[tearing] him down', the Joker can show that everyone can be corrupted. The Joker saves his final act for _Batman_ (qv). Although it can be said he didn't break his one rule with Harvey Dent, it is quite obvious that he pushed both him and Gordon's son off the edge of a building, saving only the son. Everyone is eventually corrupted by the Joker."], ["What happened to Mike Engel?", "He is the first hostage _Batman_ (qv) tackles when he flies into the construction building. _Batman_ (qv) tells Engel to stay down. Engel nods. That is the last we see of him. The SWAT team goes inside to take out all the clowns, but they were actually hostages dressed up as the Joker's men. _Batman_ (qv) stops the SWAT team from killing any of them. So in short: he lives."], ["What happened to Lau?", "He was tied up on top of the money pile that the Joker slid down. He is never seen being taken down before the Joker lights the pile on fire. We can assume he was burned up with the money. The scene finishes before the fire reached Lau, so no screams or man-on-fire is shown, probably in an attempt to keep the film's rating at PG-13."], ["What really happens when _Batman_ (qv) is given the choice to save one person or the other?", "One interpretation: At a pivotal point in the film, _Batman_ (qv) is given two addresses and told that he can only save one of the people, those two people being either Harvey Dent or Rachel. _Batman_ (qv) leaves the station and says he is going for Rachel. Commissioner Gordon leaves the police station to rescue Harvey. But the Joker, knowing _Batman_ (qv) will choose Rachel (\"The way you threw yourself after her\" suggests the Joker was aware of _Batman_ (qv)'s affection for Rachel), has lied. He switched the addresses. Thus, while _Batman_ (qv) intended to save Rachel, he \"saves\" Harvey instead. The Joker needs Harvey alive for his 'ace in the hole'. Meanwhile, the police, having heard the Joker's confession, race to save the other party. But for some reason (perhaps the Bat-Pod is faster than a squadcar, or one address is farther than the other), they don't arrive in time, and Rachel dies in the explosion. The goal is that Harvey would survive, Rachel would die, both would talk before the end, and both had the potential to be saved (though the Joker was able to time the events so that only _Batman_ (qv) would save one person quickly enough) so Harvey would think Gordon had failed him.\n\nAnother interpretation: The Joker had switched the addresses knowing that either outcome would benefit him. If _Batman_ (qv) had made the \"right\" choice and gone for Harvey (thus finding Rachel), Harvey would die; and Gotham would be left without its \"White Knight.\" The public would hold _Batman_ (qv) responsible, turning them against their protector. This is less likely, as Harvey's death probably meant very little to the Joker: being the mastermind he was, Harvey's death would be an easy task for him, but corrupting him beforehand takes more skill, with greater final effect: the final scene of the film shows Harvey (although dead) being presented as Gotham's Saviour, meaning the idea he lived for could continue. Knowing that he had killed \"five [people], two of them cops\" would undo that work, so Harvey had to be around to commit the murders.\nIt is said at the end of the movie that Rachel died at 250 52 street, where dent was supposed to be . So the joker switched the addresses."], ["Didn't _Batman_ (qv) violate his code of not killing his enemies?", "There is no definitive answer. Some say _Batman_ (qv) broke his code; others say he did not. The answers hinge on interpretation of intent and outcome. Some argue that even if _Batman_ (qv) accidentally kills one of his foes, it is still a violation of the code, while others argue that an accidental killing does not count.\n\nOne interpretation: _Batman_ (qv) did break his one rule in order to save Gordon's son, which is what the Joker prophesied earlier in the film by saying, \"Tonight you're going to break your one rule.\" However, the Joker's initial plan was to get _Batman_ (qv) to kill the Joker himself; showing that everyone is corruptible. _Batman_ (qv) beat him and showed that the Joker couldn't force him to break his rule. Later, _Batman_ (qv) chooses to break his rule by killing Two-Face. The moral is that _Batman_ (qv) won't be forced into doing anything by a maniac. He chooses to do the right thing even though people might hate him for it.\n\nAnother interpretation: _Batman_ (qv) pushed Two-Face away to save Gordon's son, but Two-Face wouldn't let the boy go. _Batman_ (qv)'s choice was to save Gordon's son and let Two-Face fall or vice-versa. _Batman_ (qv) chose to let Two-Face fall; but he didn't kill him.\n\n3rd Interpretation: No, _Batman_ (qv) did not violate his code. At the end of _Batman_ (qv) Begins, his final words to Ra's al Ghul were, \"I won't kill you, but I don't have to save you.\" When faced with the choice of saving the innocent or bringing the guilty to justice, _Batman_ (qv) will always choose the former. Had he stopped the train, the water under Wayne Enterprises would have been vaporized as well, with catastrophic results. With regards to the next question, there were still innocent lives at stake when he chose not to save Ra's. In the Joker's case, there was no imminent collateral damage for _Batman_ (qv) to consider. Therefore, he could safely apprehend Joker without causing innocent people to be harmed, which was the completely opposite course of events the Joker had intended.\n\n4th Interpretation: _Batman_ (qv) killed Two-Face by accident. He did not mean to actually kill Two-Face when he tackled him, but merely meant to overpower him and lost control in the scuffle. Seeing as how an innocent life was at stake, _Batman_ (qv) simply acted on reflex to protect the innocent (Gordon's son) and miscalculated the amount of strength necessary to take on Two-Face, leading to his death."], ["Why did Alfred destroy Rachel's letter?", "Rachel wrote to Bruce, telling him that she has chosen Harvey Dent over him. Alfred destroyed the letter to stop Bruce from getting his heart broken. This is an important point in the film: the truth hurts. Gotham's spirit depends on the lie that _Batman_ (qv) had killed the people that were really victims of Two-Face, and Bruce's ability to cope with the situation depends on the hope that Rachel would wait for him. Sustaining the lie was the key to being able to stay strong after the events of _The Dark Knight_ (qv)."], ["Is there a secret scene after the credits?", "No. A dedication to 'Heath Ledger' (qv) and Conway Wickliffe does appear about two minutes into the credits."], ["Are there any deleted scenes?", "According to rumor, Nolan was pleased with most of what he shot, so very little ended up on the cutting room floor. Reading the screenplay bears this out: whatever cuts were made were minor cuts to existing scenes, as there are no scenes in the screenplay that do not appear in the film."], ["What are the references to _Batman_ (qv) comic books?", "_Batman_ (qv), who made his first appearance in DETECTIVE COMICS #27, and has been popular in comic books ever since, is a reference in himself. _Batman_ (qv) Begins referenced the comic book stories Year One, Long Halloween and Man Who Falls. _The Dark Knight_ (qv) will continue the Long Halloween's idea of an alliance between _Batman_ (qv), Harvey Dent and Jim Gordon and make reference to such Joker stories as The Joker's Five-Way Revenge (from BATMAN #251), The Killing Joke and The Man Who Laughs. Look for many references to The Killing Joke and The Man Who Laughs. Christopher Nolan handed a copy of each to 'Heath Ledger' (qv) prior to filming in order to prepare for the role. The title of this film is taken from a nickname that was first bestowed upon _Batman_ (qv) in the comic book BATMAN, issue #1 (Spring 1940). Frank Miller, whose work inspired Nolan in _Batman_ (qv) Begins, also used the term for his 1986 comic book mini-series, _Batman_ (qv): _The Dark Knight_ (qv) Returns."], ["How did 'Heath Ledger' (qv)'s death affect the film?", "'Heath Ledger' (qv), who died on Jan 22, 2008 had finished filming his role of the Joker in _The Dark Knight_ (qv). His death had little, if any, effect on the finished film. Warner Bros. restructured its marketing campaign to focus more on _Batman_ (qv). Up until Ledger's death, it had concentrated on the Joker. But the Joker didn't disappear from the campaign. Trailers for the movie still included him and posters for the film still had his signature line, \"Why so serious?\" Ledger's death did not affect the U.S. release date, which was July 18, 2008. Nolan said that The Joker would now not appear in the sequel _The Dark Knight_ (qv) Rises. The film (_The Dark Knight_ (qv)) is dedicated to 'Heath Ledger' (qv).

Wilson was denied a screen credit, because Wilson had been \"blacklisted\" as a Communist sympathizer by HUAC in the early 1950s. Sam Spiegel tried to force Wilson to sign a document disavowing all of his Communist ties. Wilson refused, and after Bolt took over the project, he became the sole credited writer. Wilson appealed for credit to Bolt, but Bolt was unsympathetic. Bolt and David Lean were instrumental in blocking Wilson's credit when the film was restored in 1989, and he was not listed on the credits until a video release in the 1990s after Lean and Bolt had both died. Exactly what each writer contributed is a source of contention, but it can be summed up as follows: Wilson contributed many of the historical inventions of the film: the relationship between Lawrence and Ali, the rescue/execution of Gassim, the Lowell Thomas/Bentley character, for instance. However, Bolt and Wilson's scripts were of a decidedly different focus. Wilson drew a broader analysis of the story's political context, while Bolt focused on Lawrence himself.

Is Teddy lying/truthful? Did Leonard's wife actually die and if she did how did she die? Was there a 2nd attacker? Was there even an attack? Is Teddy the 2nd attacker? etc, etc. In most regards it does not matter what we believe happened in the backstory. The \"twist\" is independent of all of that. The twist in the film is that at the end, no matter what the truth is, Leonard believes that Teddy is not the 2nd attacker. If Leonard believed that Teddy were the 2nd attacker, he would kill him then and there. Even though he does not believe Teddy is the 2nd attacker (whether he is or not) he still decides to set him up. Leonard even indicates in the voice-over before setting up Teddy that he does not even think the Teddy could be the 2nd attacker: \"You think I just want another puzzle to solve? Another John G to look for? You're a John G. So you can be my John G. Do I lie to myself to be happy? In your case, Teddy, yes, I will.\" We can argue why and/or how moral/immoral his actions are, but his actions demonstrate he does not believe Teddy is the 2nd attacker and is abandoning any quest for the 2nd attacker. Whether this means that Leonard believes him to be dead, \"unfindable\" or some other reason is not explicitly indicated. Writing down Teddy's license plate indicates that Leonard believes that the 2nd attacker is already dead (or unknowable or no longer worth hunting) and is choosing to set himself up to kill Teddy, a man he does not believe to be the 2nd attacker. So Leonard admits to consciously choosing to lie to himself in order to continue on a \"false quest\" in order to make himself happy."], ["What is the story from the movie's plot assuming that the film provides an exposition?", "There tend to be several schools of thought regarding the film's interpretation. One is that Teddy is lying at the end and that there is no full exposition in the film or even that the film encourages one to create their own explanation. The second school of thought is that Teddy provides the exposition for the film. Even though there is no confirmation of Teddy's story, there is also nothing refuting it and Teddy is the only source of information in the film for the events from the attack to the start of the film, so it is the most complete explanation which can come from the film. The events leading up to and through the movie are with this presumption (also included are added \"facts\" from the supplemental material for completeness). Unlike the movie, this explanation is presented in chronological order.\n\nLeonard is an insurance investigator. One of his early cases is Sammy Jankis. Leonard relates how Sammy was in a car accident and acquired \"anterograde memory dysfunction\" (AMD). Leonard studies up and learns about this condition, and investigates Sammy and his testing. Sammy is not married and he is eventually discovered to be faking his condition. [It seems that the big \"giveaway\" to the audience is due to Sammy's incorrect assumptions on this condition. He did not pretend to learn through conditioning and kept getting shocked by the same electrified objects instead of learning to avoid them, as someone with AMD would do.]\n\nLater Leonard and his wife were attacked. His wife was raped. Leonard killed one of the attackers, but he was hit in the head by the 2nd attacker. His wife, however, did not die in the attack. After the attack, Leonard (ironically) got AMD, the same condition he studied about earlier. Leonard was not focused and was content to just pretty much do nothing. He had no goals to drive him to do anything. [There are many possibilities about what happened with this investigation, most likely the cops took an easy way out (as Leonard suggested) and never looked for a second attacker...] His wife tried working with him, but eventually got \"sick of this\" and decided to try to snap Leonard out of it or just wanted to die. She used her diabetes to either \"test Leonard\" or (more likely) have him assist in killing her with an insulin OD. At this point, Teddy is brought in to investigate Leonard's wife's death. Leonard, on some level, \"remembers\" killing her and starts to become more \"focused\".\n\nTeddy and Leonard piece do some investigation on finding Leonard's new quest, the hunt for the 2nd attacker. They eventually discover a partial name (John G), which coincidentally also matches Teddy's name. Leonard eventually is found \"not guilty\" of the death (most likely due to his condition) and is placed in a mental institute. During his stay, he learns to cope better with his condition, through notes and photos. He has a focus and a goal (finding and killing John G).\n\nLeonard escapes from the institute and somehow hooks back up with Teddy. Teddy and Leonard track down and kill the 2nd attacker. Leonard gets his picture taken with his finger pointing to his chest. Leonard's quest is complete, Teddy is happy to have helped in the vengeance. BUT, the \"killing\" does not \"stick\". Leonard does not believe it as well as some other elements of the truth, and starts to \"delete items\" from the file. Teddy leads Leonard along, continuing the investigation for some time. Eventually Teddy reluctantly decides to try and make Leonard happy again, by finding some \"bad guy\", killing him, and also making some money. He decides on Jimmy Grantz. He feeds info to Leonard to indicate that the first name may also be \"James\" (not just \"John\") and begins the feeding to Leonard of the information.\n\nThe movie takes place a little over a year since the killing of the 2nd attacker, Leonard discovers the truth and decides to setup Teddy. Like the items in his file that do not match Leonard's belief of what happened, the evidence that he has already killed 2 \"John G\"s is destroyed, and Teddy is \"marked for deletion\" by Leonard with the \"fact\" of the license plate. Leonard finds a note from Natalie (meant for Jimmy to meet her \"after\") and thinks it is for him. He meets Natalie at Ferdy's bar. Natalie tries using Leonard to kill Dodd, Jimmy's partner, who she wants out of the picture because she says Dodd may come after her looking for the money. Leonard will not kill for Natalie but runs Dodd out of town. Natalie takes pity on Leonard and helps him in his quest by running the license plate for him. Leonard then meets Teddy after convincing himself that Teddy is John G, and kills him. Leonard probably killed the first John G right after escaping (which was \"over a year ago\" as Teddy said in the film)."], ["Is Teddy lying or truthful during his exposition?", "It can not be proved whether he is truthful or not, based on information in the film since there is no reliable narrator to confirm anything, and thus the opinion on this tends to be split. The biggest support for he his telling the truth tends to come from that it provides an answer to the mysteries in the film. The other fact is that Leonard seems to believe him, which he would have no reason to do if he believed Teddy was a liar. However, Teddy is definitely not ALWAYS truthful and he is shown using Leonard's condition and manipulating him and even admits to lying.\n\nNolan has provided several commentaries for the film, one where he claims Teddy is being truthful but also another where he claims Teddy is lying seemingly supporting both interpretations.\n\nTeddy's reminding Leonard of his real name (in spite of the danger connected) adds credibility to his words, as does the photograph. Most importantly, however, Leonard's actions show that he believes Teddy and indicates to us that Teddy is telling the truth, as in we do not know the truth of it, but Leonard does. If Leonard knew Teddy was lying, and that his true quest was not done, some argue he would not have changed the hunt to Teddy. Leonard is shown remembering giving his wife injections, he is shown lying and denying it. Leonard even admits to himself he will lie to himself. He sets up Teddy (knowing he is not the 2nd attacker) and decides to make himself never believe Teddy by lying to himself and saying that Teddy is a liar.\n\nHowever, as Leonard himself said in the film, \"memories can be distorted, they're an interpretation, not a record.\" Long term memory degrades in time also, whether people have Leonard's condition or not. Leonard's memory of himself giving his wife an injection can be simply that - an imagination, a distortion of his memories, an indication that neither Teddy nor Leonard is reliable. In other words he stalls, confirming that Teddy's confusing (and untruthful) logic is working to at least to some effect, though why Leonard is so confused that he would imagine preparing syringes before Teddy mentions Leonard's wife being diabetic and also has them long after he has forgotten Teddy seems to raise some doubts about the \"imagination\" aspect of it."], ["What are some of the interpretations of '_Memento_ (qv)' when one presumes the film provides no exposition?", "One can accept the exposition provided in the film by Teddy. As Nolan indicated in one of the commentary track: \"A lot of people watch the film would rather believe Teddy and the appalling ideas that he presents than to go without an answer\". Since the film does not provide any proof of whether Teddy is lying or not, is also allows one to presume that Teddy is lying and that the film provides no answers. This allows viewers to create dozens of alternative theories and to make speculations that don't come from the film. Some of these involve only presuming that Teddy lying, some presume that Leonard is lying, and some presume that Leonard may be faking his condition. Some raise the question of whether Leonard could literally be Sammy Jankis or that Sammy is completely fictional, whether or not there was an attack, whether Leonard was married, etc. If there was an attack, speculation on Dodd's and Natalie's role in the attack and in the setup of Jimmy and Teddy has also been debated. Some alternative theories even involve manipulations by characters never shown within the film. There is even speculation that Teddy made up the story of Sammy Jankis and somehow has the ability to implant it into Leonard's mind. In addition to the dozens of alternate theories possible when Teddy is presumed to be lying, there are essentially an infinite number of possibilities if one presumes that the events in the film did not happen at all or may be just shadows and inaccurate recollections of one of the characters or even that the film is meant to be just an enormous dream sequence."], ["Is there a final truth to MEMENTO?", "In the Salon Article \"Everything you wanted to know about '_Memento_ (qv)'\" Andy Klein discusses this idea. He indicates: Is there an answer? I don't know. 'Christopher Nolan' (qv) claims there is one. In an article in New Times Los Angeles on March 15, [2001, when the movie was released in the US] Scott Timberg writes: 'Nolan, for his part, won't tell. When asked about the film's outcome, he goes on about ambiguity and subjectivity, but insists he knows the movie's Truth -- who's good, who's bad, who can be trusted and who can't -- and insists that close viewing will reveal all.' (note for context: Klein also goes onto say that he believes Nolan is not being totally truthful about this, but Klein admits that does not know.)Nolan also commented on the film having answers: I believe the answers are all there in the film, but the terms of the storytelling deliberately prevent people from finding them. If you watch the film, and abandon your conventional desire for absolute truth - and the confirmation of absolute truth that most films provide you with - then you can find all the answers you're looking for. As far as I'm concerned, my view is very much in the film - the answers are all there for the attentive viewer, but the terms of the storytelling prevent me from being able to give the audience absolute confirmation. And that's the point. From James Mottram's \"The Making of _Memento_ (qv)\", 2002, Faber and Faber Limited, page 26.So one of the problems Nolan gives to us is that we never know what the truth is. There are thus many possible ways to analyze the film even though not all the interpretations seem to be equally likely.\n\nIn an Interview with Chuck Stephens for Filmmaker magazine in 2001 Nolan also stated: The most interesting part of that for me is that audiences seem very unwilling to believe the stuff that Teddy [Pantoliano] says at the end and yet why? I think its because people have spent the entire film looking at Leonard's photograph of Teddy, with the caption: \"Don't believe his lies.\" That image really stays in people's heads, and they still prefer to trust that image even after we make it very clear that Leonard's visual recollection is completely questionable. It was quite surprising, and it wasn't planned. What was always planned was that we dont ever step completely outside Leonard's head, and that we keep the audience in that interpretive mode of trying to analyze what they want to believe or not. For me, the crux of the movie is that the one guy who might actually be the authority on the truth of what happened is played by Joe Pantoliano [_The Matrix_ (qv), Bound], who is so untrustworthy, especially given the baggage he carries in from his other movies: he's already seen by audiences as this character actor who's always unreliable. I find it very frightening, really, the level of uncertainty and malevolence Joe brings to the film."], ["What is the sequence of scenes in the film?", "Chronologically, the black-and-white sequences come first, the color sequences come next. The color sequences are alternated with black-and-white sequences. The bw sequences are put together in the correct chronological order. The color ones, though shown forward (except for the very first one) are ordered in reverse. Overall this gives the film a \"hairpin plotting\" alternating from \"reverse flowing\" pathway to \"forward flowing\" pathway. Using the numbering scheme suggested by Andy Klein in his Article for Salon magazine who took numbers from 1 to 22 for the bw scenes and letters A-V for the color ones the plotting of the film as presented is: Opening Credits (shown \"backwards\"), 1, V, 2, U, 3, T, 4, S, ..., 22/A, Credits. There is a smooth transition from BW sequence 22 to color sequence A and it occurs during the development of a polaroid photo.

Stefano Ghislotti also has an article called \"Backwards: Memory and Fabula Construction in _Memento_ (qv) by 'Christopher Nolan' (qv)\" which discusses how Nolan provides us the clues necessary for us to decode the plotline as we watch and help us understand the story from it."], ["Why does the film have a non-linear plot structure?", "While Nolan has never discussed the reasons in detail, there has been some speculation on what purposes within the film the non-linear plotting may seem to serve.\n\n1) The reverse color sequencing puts us into Leonard's mind. We have to \"go with the flow\" like Leonard does and try to understand what things are with little or no context. We get confused a little and must make assumptions and deductions, just like Leonard must do. But unlike Leonard, we can see how well we \"guessed\" what was going on, since we can put the events more into context when we see the later movie scenes (earlier story scenes)\n\n2) It puts the twist at the end of the film instead of only one third of the way into the story.\n\n3) It allows Nolan to play with our perceptions of the characters. At the beginning their motivations seem very clear, but at the end we just can not be sure. We initially see (in movie order) Teddy as the 2nd attacker, Leonard as the hero, Natalie as the helper when we first meet them. At the end of the film, these perceptions are much less clear. Is Teddy the 2nd attacker, is he a villian, is he actually more of a friend/victim? Natalie is shown to be using Leonard, but was she also taking pity on him and is trying to help on some level? At the end of the film we see Leonard's actions (setting up Teddy) but his motivations are much less clear at the end. We don't know if he is abandoning the real quest believing it is unattainable or if he feels that Jimmy deserves vengeance more than his own wife or even if he is trying to eliminate Teddy so that he is never reminded that the 2nd attacker is dead. The movie is not explicit with its answers.\n\n4) The hairpin narrative of the plotting is set up like a spiral (see this FAQ for a detail of the sequences of the film). This sequencing and the theme of repetition has been seen as a way to suggest Leonard's life after his wife's death as a spiral: the events in the past have happened similarly before, and that they may happen again, It has also been seen as a moral lesson to the audience: The path Leonard seems to have chosen may ultimately drag him down and destroy him if he can't get out of the loop.\n\n5) It's really the only way to have the audience relate to Leonard (not knowing what happened prior). Were it to all be connected linearly, we would know everything that happened prior which would make the story more predictable and less interesting. We would know from the beginning that Leonard had set himself on the path to kill Teddy and the how wouldn't really have much of a twist"], ["What facts can we get about what occurred from watching the film?", "While some may believe anything we see may be subject to interpretation and none is objective facts (only subjective) this analysis leads to an infinite number of solutions for an answer and allows any interpretation to be valid which does not seem to be a reasonable answer. It seems more likely that we should accept the events that we see occur during the film to be true. Most people seem to believe that the events we see occur in the movie are facts. For example, we see Leonard kill Teddy. This then becomes a fact. The reason he did it, what he believes at the time can all be conjectured, but they will never be facts. On the other hand, the \"Sammy Story\" or the recollection of the attack that Leonard tells to people, are not composed of facts. It would be a fact that Leonard stated these things, but the events we \"see\" Leonard tell us about, we did not see happen: Leonard may be lying or just mistaken. We can conjecture things that do not agree with what Leonard says, but those conjectures must be supportable by being able to explain why Leonard is lying or how he becomes mistaken. There must be a motivation for someone to lie (not simply that he is lying, since he is a liar) that is part of the theory.\n\nWhen the story is broken out (with no other conjectures) we can see the events we would then judge as facts: The chronology starts with the second scene in the film (the first Black & White scene). The BW scenes are in order and go thru the initial chronology. Leonard is in the hotel talking on the phone, explaining about Sammy and shaving his leg. The person on the phone (presumably Teddy, though we are never shown for sure who it is) is giving him some info about the case. Leonard tattoos fact 5 (\"drug dealer\") and eventually meets Teddy and goes to meet a man (Jimmy Grantz) who Leonard thinks killed his wife. Leonard meets and kills Jimmy and takes his picture. As his picture develops we move from BW to the color sequences. [Note these sequences while shown forward, are ordered in reverse order and alternate with the BW sequences]\n\nTeddy comes (pretends he does not know Leonard, though Leonard is aware that they have met due to his note on Teddy's picture) and Leonard gets angry with him. Leonard is also upset that Jimmy seemed to know about Sammy which means he also must have met Jimmy before now. Teddy tells Leonard that Sammy was a faker with no wife and that Leonard's wife was diabetic. Leonard decides to set Teddy up as his next victim by writing down Teddy's license plate as \"fact 6\" and also indicating that he should not believe Teddy's lies. Leonard tosses Teddy's keys, steals Jimmy's car and leaves Teddy trying to find his keys. Leonard goes to Emma's and gets fact 6 tattooed on his leg. Teddy finds Leonard there. They argue, Leonard sneaks out the back, finds a note that Natalie gave to Jimmy in the clothes Leonard stole, and thinking it is meant for him, goes to meet Natalie at the bar. Natalie seems suspicious and a little afraid of this man in Jimmy's clothes and car and tries to figure out what is going on. Leonard tells her about his condition and she tests him with the \"spit drink\". Later they leave the bar and go to her house. At Natalie's, Leonard explains about the attack and Natalie eventually leaves Leonard alone in her home. When she returns she comes back acting upset, hides all the pens, and tries to convince Leonard to kill Dodd. She even tells Leonard that she is going to use him. She gets Leonard angry enough to punch her. She then leaves. She waits in her car for some time, presumably giving time for Leonard to forget, and then returns pretending that Dodd beat her up. She gives him info about Dodd and how Leonard can find him. Leonard leaves. Teddy is waiting in Leonard's car and tries to convince Leonard that Natalie is not to be trusted. Leonard writes this on her picture, but after Teddy leaves the \"don't believe his lies\" convinces him to cross it out. Teddy also told him to get a room at the discount inn, which he does. (and Burt gives him a new room) At the motel, he calls an escort and \"relives the attack\". He then leaves with the items from the motel and burns them during the rest of the evening.\n\nIn the morning, Dodd finds Leonard and tries to kill him. Leonard escapes and using the note from Natalie, waits for Dodd in Dodd's motel room. Leonard showers and eventually beats up Dodd and ties him up in the closet. Not knowing what to do later he calls Teddy. Teddy and Leonard \"run Dodd out of town\". Later Leonard finds the picture of Dodd and Natalie's note and confronts her about Dodd. Leonard spends the night at Natalie's. The next morning Leonard and Natalie setup a meeting when they can meet and Natalie can provide info she will get from her friend at the DMV about \"John G\"s license plate. Leonard leaves, Teddy is waiting and they go to lunch. Leonard then goes back to the Discount Inn but has no key. Burt takes him into his old room and tells him about renting more than 1 room. Leonard sees the note about his meeting with Natalie. Leonard meets Natalie at the cafe, where she gives him the license plate info which is Teddy's driver's license info (exactly as Leonard intended when he wrote it down). Natalie gives Leonard an address/directions to an \"abandoned place outside of town\" where her boyfriend did \"bigger deals\". They both leave and Leonard goes back to the Discount Inn. Back in his room, Leonard looks over his facts, calls Teddy, notices that Teddy is the man on the license photo, realizes what the facts indicate had occurred, adds the note to Teddy's picture \"He is the one\" and then \"kill him\". Leonard meets Teddy in the lobby and they drive to the abandoned location where Leonard shoots Teddy.\n\nWhile this description details what happens in the film it really does not explain anything. It is like a mystery movie, we know the facts of what happened and who was killed, but we want to know the details of what happened. Why did the events occur as they did. Are people lying, when and why? There are all sorts of questions that are raised during the film. A listing of the facts is just not enough to satisfy us. We must analyze the film to try to understand it."], ["Where can I find the original short story by 'Jonathan Nolan' (qv) and the movie's script?", "'Jonathan Nolan' (qv)'s short story _Memento_ (qv) Mori was inspired by an idea he had about a man with AMD obsessed with revenge.

There are 2 writing nominations possible: The \"Adapted Screenplay\" is awarded to the writer of a screenplay adapted from another source (novel or play usually) and the \"Original Screenplay\" is awarded to the writer of a script not based on previously published material. The key point in the distinction is the phrase \"previously published\". The film _Memento_ (qv) was released before the short story was published, so based on the Academy rules, it was not based on any previously published material so was considered an \"original screenplay\".

Early on, Nolan and his director of photography, Wally Pfister, saw the black-and-white dailies (printed to black-and-white stock), and marvelled at the sharp contrast. \"I had the deep blacks, so I felt I was right on course,\" says Pfister. When they were printed to colour, contrast and sharpness was lost, and an unwelcome colour tint was gained. \"It was really a downer,\" he adds: \"Chris really accepted it. For me it was such a disappointment. In the end, when we had to print to colour, the lab really were never able to nail the look. You inherently get a colour tinting on it, so we had to choose between a reddish tint or a blueish tint. In the end, we aimed towards the blue.\"\n\nFrom James Mottram's \"The Making of _Memento_ (qv)\", 2002, Faber and Faber Limited, page 87."], ["How does Leonard know he has a condition?", "People with this condition sometimes do know they have this condition. The \"classic example\" is a case study of a man called \"H.M.\" [after his death in 2008, the need for anonymity was gone and his name was revealed to be Henry Molaison]. H.M.'s was a \"pure case\" caused by surgery and not an accident. He had epileptic seizures and the doctors believed that if they removed some of his temporal lobe (including the hippocampus), then he would no longer get them. The doctors were correct in this respect: they cured him of his seizures. He also got this condition since (it was later discovered) the hippocampus is important to the \"consolidation\" of memory (converting the short-term to long-term memory).\n\nH.M. does know he has a condition: \"In case you're wondering, he was aware of his condition as illustrated in his often quoted statement: 'Every day is alone in itself, whatever enjoyment I've had, and whatever sorrow I've had. Right now, I'm wondering. Have I done or said anything amiss? You see, at this moment\neverything looks clear to me, but what happened just before? That's what worries me.

Salat, et al: \"His [H.M.] insight into his condition is excellent. He is always aware that he has a memory impairment and does not confabulate to conceal it.\"\n\nClive Wearing, who has one the most severe cases of this condition, seems to be aware of his problem and will speak about it. Dr Michael Oddy, Neuropsychologist, Ticehurst House Hospital (where Clive stays) indicates in THE MIND, 2nd EDITION. The Clive Wearing Story, Part 2: Living Without Memory (Part 2a): \"We try to train the staff so that they don't ask Clive questions or begin discussions which put a load on his memory. For example, if you ask Clive 'How are you today?' there's an implicit demand on 'Well, I'm better today than I was yesterday' and he gets quite upset and he will then start to talk about how he's been ill and how he can see and hear for the first time.\"\n\nThe \"Remember Sammy Jankis\" tattoo is also an aid to Leonard to associate his \"problem\" with his real investigation of Sammy and his discovery of this condition. He realizes he has a problem and can then deduce what it is from the clues at hand."], ["Does Leonard have the AMD or is he faking?", "Both from the point of view of movie consistency and judging by the information offered by the film, in spite of possibilities of various interpretations, most believe Leonard is not faking and really suffers from the anterograde amnesia. There are several things which really demonstrate that he is not faking: (1) Why would Leonard \"fake\" even when he is alone: who is he faking for (us, the viewers of the film)? (2) Why would Leonard put himself in danger by \"knowingly\" chasing after a man (Dodd) who has a gun and is trying to kill him? (3) Why would Leonard put himself in danger by showering in the room of a man (Dodd) who wants to kill him? (4) Why does Leonard need to \"lie to himself\" (since if he were faking, he would not be lying to himself; he would know that Teddy is not John G.) to set Teddy up for killing? If he decided that he wanted to kill Teddy, why not just kill him? Why would he need to \"fool himself\" by tattooing the license plate? (5) Another indication is while in the bathroom, Leonard tries to wash off his \"remember Sammy Jankis\" tattoo. If Leonard were faking he would know it was not written on, but tattooed, so he would have no reason to try to wash it off.\n\nAlso, if Leonard were faking, when and why did he even start to fake it? Why would he start faking after the accident? If his wife died in the accident (as some believe) why pretend to fake the condition, as it would otherwise be so much easier to get vengeance. If his wife died \"testing the faking\" with the insulin (as others believe), then Leonard knowingly killed her - which then begs for a motive of why Leonard decided to kill his wife. There are some questions on things he seems to remember which can be explained by editing. It is clear we do not see Leonard 24 hours per day / 7 days a week. We only see him for a total of about 2 hours over the course of presumably about 3 days. There is a lot of information that we do not see."], ["If Leonard is not faking and has AMD how can he remember...", "(1) ...Burt's name when Burt is showing him the wrong room? (2) ...the note on Natalie's pic about helping out of pity? (3) ... to lock the car doors after Teddy tells him to? (4) ...that he is on Tattoo Fact 6? These are some questions that come up periodically and seem to indicate to people that Leonard must be faking despite the other evidence/facts in the film that clearly indicate that he is not faking. While it is possible that all of these instances are just goofs in the film, all of these can be explained by editing. There does not seem to be any reason to presume errors, when editing explains things very well. It is clear we do not see Leonard 24 hours per day / 7 days a week. We only see him for a total of about 2 hours over the course of presumably about 3 days. There is a lot of information that we do not see. It should be clear that just because we do not actually see Leonard (or anyone else) do something that not seeing it does is not meant to indicate that it is not done. While we see Leonard go to the bathroom, we never see him have a bowel movement. That does not mean we should presume that Nolan is indicating that this condition makes Leonard no longer able to have a bowel movement or that the condition allows him no longer to need bowel movements. These parts have been edited out as they are in most movies, even when people do not have a mental condition. Also, if we see Leonard at point A and then at point D, barring other info, it can be presumed that he went thru points B and C. It does not prove that he went thru points B and C, but there is nothing to indicate that he did not so; it is a valid presumption.\n\nAdditionally, as with all of us, Leonard's memory appears to work better sometimes and sometimes (also like most of us!) his memory appears to not work well at all! It appears that film subtly hints on occasions that Leonard is able to hold his memory for extraordinary amounts of time, for a man with his condition.\n\n - Knowing Burt's name: In the case of Leonard knowing Burt's name, we are shown on different occasions (in the lobby, on the phone, etc) that Burt tells Leonard his name. It is almost as if he is amazed that Leonard can not remember him. When Leonard and Burt go from the lobby to Leonard's old room, there is a cut and we do not hear their conversation in transit. It is not improbable that they talked during this time and Burt could have mentioned his name again. Thus when Leonard referred to him by name, he might have just heard it offscreen.\n\n - Note on Natalie's pic about helping out of pity: This is the strongest scene in the film that indicates Leonard may be faking since he seems to have held onto his memory for an extraordinary amount of time, perhaps an hour or so. Of course it is another that can be explained easily by editing. Natalie tells Leonard she lost someone, then time passes. Leonard gets up in the middle of the night and writes on Natalie's pic that she will help him out of pity. This is a long time for him to remember if he is remembering when we saw them discuss it. However, it is not hard to imagine that Leonard had repeat conversations on many subjects. Nolan wisely does not show us all this repetition. The fact is that we do not see or hear the conversation that took place while they were in bed, immediately before Leonard gets up. It is possible that this was the very conversation that they were having. Supporting this is the sorrowful look on Natalie's face. Her face is consistent with someone who had just been speaking about someone they had lost recently.\n\n - Locking the car door: This seems to have been put in by Nolan as a red herring to give people a suggestion that he may be faking, while providing other clues to indicate that he is definitely not faking. The facts are that we see Leonard lock his car everytime (at least everytime he does so on camera) after he finds Teddy in his car and Teddy tells him to lock his car. Leonard even does this even when it makes no sense, since much of the time the window is broken. But just because we see him lock it afterwards, is in no way proof that he did not lock it before. Many people lock their car doors and make it a habit. [Many parents try to instill the habit in their children even before they drive: you get out of the car, you lock the door; you get in the car and you buckle the seatbelt.] So even though Nolan made a point of showing him lock his car after Teddy told him to, does not mean that Leonard did not do it before Teddy told him to do it.\n\nIt has been brought up that all the times we see Leonard get out of his car before Teddy told him to lock, we never see Leonard lock the door. This is true: we never see him lock the door. But the fact remains, we never see him not lock the door, either. We do not know whether the door was locked or not. We see Leonard get out of the car 3 times before Teddy tells him to lock it: 1) At Emma's for Tattoo 2) At Ferdy's Bar by the dumpster 3) At Natalie's house. In not one of these scenes is it shown whether or not he locks the car. In every case, the scene is cut before Leonard would be locking it. It may be speculated that perhaps Nolan and Dody Dorn cut these scenes quickly for a reason and showed later in other scenes that he was locking. Their intent may have been to confuse some of the viewers and make them come to a conclusion that Leonard is faking if they do not pay attention to the other clues in the film. They are misleading by not showing us something, allowing people to believe something that may not be true. Also, even though we do not see whether or not Leonard locked the door outside Emma's, we are shown that when he leaves Emma's he definitely unlocks the door. While this is not proof he had it locked, but if he is conditioned to unlock it, it supports the notion that he could be conditioned to also lock it. So since we have 3 instances that we do not know whether he locked or not, and no instances when we are shown him not locking it, there does not seem to be any proof that Leonard never locks the car before Teddy tells him to. While it is a habit that people lock their car doors or that it is common sense for them to do so, people also forget to do it. Even if Leonard did lock the car door, he could forget to do it just as people without this condition would do. Even given his condition, he would not be any more likely to forget since locking the door is an implicit response formed by habit and routine.\n\n - Tattoo Fact 6: This is probably the most controversial. The editing is not really that apparent; the scene is almost cut as one long shot, so a time delay is really not apparent. Based on the script, it is apparent that other scenes were to be put into the sequence. These were either filmed and cut or not filmed at all. In either case, they are not in the film and the sequence seems to have no real breaks in the action. Many people just presume and accept that the sequence is an editing error, and leave it at that. However, it can still be explained through editing. We know that Leonard makes lists, he summarizes his facts for easy retrieval. It is possible (i.e. there is nothing in the film that makes it impossible) that Leonard has made a list of tattoo facts that he can refer to. If he did have a list, a good place for it would be in his pocket with the notecards so he would see it when he was going to tattoo a fact. It is even possible that he writes the facts on a card then to make sure it is not lost; he could write the next one onto the back of this card. Then later, after getting the tattoo, he would rewrite the list and place it in his pocket, ready for the next one. The list is the tattoos he has, the card is the tattoos he needs. In the sequence of events, we do not see everything that Leonard looks at, but it is clear that he looks down in the direction of his pocket. It is possible that he could pick out a card with tattoo facts 1-5 listed, could note that it goes to 5 (he would not have to read the facts), turn the card over and write Fact 6 on the card and proceed. There are no facts in the film which make this impossible and it is consistent with Leonard's behavior throughout the film."], ["Is Leonard's anterograde amnesia psychological?", "No, it can not be due to the nature of anterograde amnesia. Physical damage to the brain essentially can lead to the impairment in creating new memories [anterograde amnesia, which is Leonard's problem] and may even involve impairment in recalling recently created memories [some retrograde amnesia, which does not seem to affect Leonard at all]. _Psycho_ (qv)logical impairment of memory (known as \"_Psycho_ (qv)genic Amnesia\") is caused by some intense emotional experience. The purpose for the loss is the mind's attempt to exclude painful or guilt-laden memories from consciousness. Memory is not really lost, but is misplaced. [This is retrograde amnesia, which again does not seem to affect Leonard]. These memories can be recalled by free association, hypnosis, and other procedures. The facts from the  medical literature indicate: \"In psychogenic amnesia, there is no anterograde memory loss.\" Medical literature also indicates: \"_Psycho_ (qv)genic amnesia is characterized by an inability to recall information already stored in the patient's memory.\" So if we presume that Leonard has anterograde amnesia then it must be caused by physical trauma. If we presume that his problem is emotional (and not due to any physical problem) then any amnesia is retrograde: a failure to recall painful memories. But this presumption is not consistent with what we see in the film, since the entire plot of the film involves him seeking revenge since he can remember the attack and since he does seem to have memories of an insulin OD."], ["If Teddy told the truth about the 2nd attacker, could Leonard remember killing him?", "This question is never answered in the film, the supplemental material does not offer any clues, nor has Nolan ever answered it. There does seem to be hint (not a suggestion) that Leonard knows, at leas on some level, that he has already killed the 2nd attacker. If he does, it is most likely a distant recollection not a conscious memory. The hint comes from Leonard's action in setting up Teddy for what he believes is a false quest (ie not a quest for the 2nd attacker).To start a false quest, it seems that he must believe that the 2nd attacker is dead since we are offered no reason of why he would not abandon the real quest for the 2nd attacker. Thus it must be a very convincing belief. Therefore, Leonard must that know Teddy is not lying about Sammy being a faker, Sammy not having a wife, or that his wife was diabetic. Because if ANY of those things are lies, Leonard would have reason to doubt Teddy about the 2nd attacker and thus would not start a false quest. Also, Leonard must NOT be able to spot any indication of falsehood in Teddy saying that the 2nd attacker being dead.\n\nBut even with all these things, Leonard would know that just because he could not spot Teddy lying, does not necessarily mean he was being truthful. So the question is would a man obsessed with vengeance, be convinced that the 2nd attacker is dead with just the word of Teddy? Given that Leonard didn't even completely believe Teddy when he was truthful about warning Leonard about Natalie makes it seem even less plausible. When told about Natalie, Leonard wrote the note in handwriting to show his future self the statement is in doubt and was written \"under duress\". But we see indication of any doubt or duress in Leonard's belief of Teddy. And if there is ANY DOUBT at all for Leonard, there is no reason to start a false quest. Thus we are led to believe that Leonard has NO DOUBTS that the 2nd attacker is dead. Thus in addition to knowing Teddy is truthful about the Sammy and insulin things and seeing no falsehood in statement that the 2nd attacker killed a year ago; Nolan also indicates that we should also conclude that, on some level, Leonard REMEMBERS that he killed the 2nd attacker (even if is it a distant memory, like a dream, or feeling of deja vu...).\n\nActually, all of this is explained in the film by two lines \"How can I heal, when I can't feel time?\" more-so toward the end of the film when Leonard asks himself \"Do I lie to myself to be happy?\" Teddy even extrapolates it in the final dialogue. It's essentially trained memory except Leonard has trained himself to not believe... otherwise what purpose would his life serve?"], ["If Teddy is truthful & if Leonard has AMD, how can he remember his wife's death?", "Some have argued that this is one of the biggest holes in the expositional theory of this film, though the \"hole\" stems from misunderstanding about AMD. Presuming Teddy is truthful denies one of what some see as the premise of the film: Leonard can not remember anything after the attack. This is the simple explanation of what anterograde memory dysfunction is - the inability to remember new things. One can argue with how accurately AMD has been portrayed in the movie (see thisFAQ for some discussion on this), but Nolan clearly has given us the \"ground rules\" of his movie portrayal. For Teddy to be telling the truth, we must accept that Leonard is able to make new memories and that he can make them selectively: he only remembers what Nolan wants him (and needs him) to remember, just for the plot twist.\n\nSome ignore the \"hole\" and just presume it \"somehow happened,\" and just explain Leonard's need to repress the memory and somehow condition himself to remember it differently. This idea not only ignores the \"hole,\" but is inconsistent with this real condition. Conditioning does not work to create memories of new facts; these are explicit memories. Conditioning creates new implicit memories. But the perception of the \"hole\" is created by ignoring the real facts of this real medical condition. The creation of new memories is possible by this condition (See this FAQ). Amnesias are never absolute: \"Amnesia is not an all-or-nothing condition, and even H.M., from time to time, has meagre conscious recollections of information encountered postoperatively.\" (See this article). [Note: H.M. (after his death in 2008, the need for anonymity was gone and his name was revealed to be Henry Molaison) is a \"classic example\" of a man with AMD. There is much online about him; google on antergorade amnesia \"H.M.\" to get a number of hits and info. H.M.'s was a \"pure case\" caused by surgery and not an accident. He had epileptic seizures and the doctors believed that if they removed some of his temporal lobe (including the hippocampus), then he would no longer get them. The doctors were correct in this respect; they cured him of his seizures. He also got this condition since (it was later discovered) the hippocampus is important to the \"consolidation\" of memory (converting the short-term to long-term memory).]\n\nNolan also suggests (provides us a clue to) this fact when he shows us a shot which may be interpreted as a memory of Leonard in a mental institute: a memory he could not have if the condition were absolute (yes, there are alternate explanations for the scene, but alternate explanations do not negate this explanation). Nolan does suggest how it is possible and why this type of memory is retained. The flash of Sammy turning into Leonard in the mental institute suggests a \"projection\" of Leonard's implicit recollections onto explicit Sammy memories. The anchor of the recollection is the Sammy memory.\n\nIt is important to realize that this condition does not force Leonard to start with a clean slate. His memories are not \"erased.\" The short-term memories are just typically not consolidated into long-term memories. However, Leonard does have experiences after the attack, and on some level bits are recalled, though maybe only subconsciously, and some relegated to show up only as \"conditioning\" (some probably to his surprise - when did I learn to do that?) other things only recalled as distant memories. These are the implicit, non-declarative memories. For example, in Oliver Sacks' book: The Man who Mistook his Wife for a Hat, he has an entire chapter on a man named \"Jimmy G.\" who got this condition (anterograde memory dysfunction) from chronic alcoholism (this is termed \"Korsakoff's syndrome\"). Sacks states: \"He [Jimmie] sometimes retained faint memories, some dim echo or sense of familiarity. Thus five minutes after I had played tic-tac-toc [sic] with him, he recollected that 'some doctor' had played this with him 'a while back' - whether the 'while back' was minutes or months ago he had no idea.\"\n\nAlso, this condition does allow you to learn through conditioning (as mentioned many times in the movie), but some things may \"break through\" that typically won't. \"Jimmy G\" is also discussed online and it has been reported that: \"Jimmy was stuck in the year 1945, it turned out. He only remembered one or two events since that year. (One was the death of his brother, which says something about the relationship of emotions and encoding.)\"\n\nIt appears that Nolan is suggesting that Leonard can recall his wife's death (to some extent). It seems that Leonard has a unique perspective. Before Leonard got this condition, he studied and learned about this condition-he observed a subject (Sammy) being tested. Then when he was tested for other items that are only vaguely recalled he was better able to \"project/transfer\" those implicit recollections onto his actual explicit (declarative) memories of Sammy. His memories of Sammy's life becomes a mixture of \"just Sammy\" items (Leonard's actual memories), items that (more or less) relate to both Sammy and Leonard, and items that are \"wholly Leonard\" that are projected onto Sammy. It even will contain some confabulations (common among people with memory problems) of items that have nothing to do with either one of them, it is just Leonard filling gaps in the story. It is a way of his mind finding an alternate method of storing these memories. Leonard is unable (due to physical damage) to put them directly into long-term memories, so the mind finds an alternate path through other sections of this brain and \"projects\" them onto Sammy-memories. These recollections are essentially misremembered. It is unconscious, not conscious: Leonard believes these things are true. When confronted with facts which dispute it he can realize the problem, but it can be confusing.\n\nThis type of mechanism can be supported by the facts of this condition: Declarative memory can be created by non-declarative means \"Thus, factual information, which is ordinarily learned as declarative (conscious) knowledge and with the participation of the medial temporal lobe, can be acquired as nondeclarative memory\" which is a means of saying that explicit memories can be learned from implicit memories as has been hypothesized as a mechanism for what Nolan seems to be suggesting. As stated, this is enhanced by Leonard's knowledge of Sammy and his explicit memories of Sammy. It has been pointed out in the classic AMD case of H.M. that \"experiments demonstrate that H.M. is capable of learning some new factual information when it can be fixed to already acquired knowledge.\" This paper even the suggests that this can lead to false memories due to incorrect anchoring. H.M. seems to have anchored some of the Challenger explosion (which happened after his AMD) with his memories of the Titanic disaster."], ["If Leonard's wife was diabetic why doesn't Leonard have memories of that?", "This seems to be a misconception among many people and the question is flawed. The movie actually shows that Leonard does have memories of her being diabetic, so the real questions should be: If Leonard's wife was diabetic why does Leonard deny it? and If Leonard's wife was not diabetic why does Leonard have memories of her being diabetic? The first point is that on 3 occasions we see Leonard with memories of him preparing an insulin injection or giving her one. There are two distinct memories. In movie sequence, they are:\n\n1) At 1:21:25, Leonard is alone watching the TV at Natalie's and has a memory flash of someone's hand tapping a syringe twice. It is a quick shot and we do not see who it is. It acts in the film as clue, a foreshadowing of a future truth. It is a supraliminal clue common with foreshadowing. We can see it, but tend not to notice it unless we are looking for it. When we see it, even if we would pause and review it, we still would be hard-pressed to know it is Leonard's hand. We learn it is Leonard' hand, later in the film when we are shown the more complete sequence. [This sequence, though earlier in the film, would occur long after Leonard would have forgotten what Teddy said about his wife, so it is clear indication that it does not come from just a \"consideration\" of what Teddy told him].\n\n2) At 1:42:50, Teddy says \"The insulin...\". At this point in the film (or in time) we (viewers or Leonard) have not heard any mention about Leonard's wife being diabetic, we have only heard the Sammy Story about the \"the insulin\". Yet after Teddy says \"The insulin...\" Leonard has that same memory we saw earlier in the film of someone tapping a syringe twice, only this time we are shown that it is indeed Leonard who is tapping the syringe to move the air bubbles to the top. Leonard denies the memory we clearly see him have, claiming: \"That's Sammy, not me\". We are not shown any \"alternate version\" of this memory like we will later with the other memory.\n\n3) At, 1:43:23 Teddy states: \"It was your wife who had diabetes\". We now see a different insulin memory than previously. It is a memory of Leonard injecting his wife's leg with insulin. Again we hear Leonard deny it: \"My wife wasn't diabetic\". Only this time when Teddy presses: \"You sure?\", we see Leonard think, and his denial is not just a lie to Teddy, but the \"visualization\" is essentially a lie to himself also, ignoring the memory and choosing to believe it was just a pinch and then claiming again: \"She wasn't diabetic\".\n\nIf Leonard's wife were not diabetic, there is no reason that he has memories (or even just thoughts) of her being diabetic at three separate times in the film: especially when two come about with no prompting about her being diabetic. The first one seems to be most likely due to the pervasive nature of his diabetic memories. It was such a part of his life with his wife, that he is bound to, while thinking of her, have some of these memories \"pop up\". If his wife were not diabetic, it seems odd for him to think about preparing an insulin injection. The second comes with just a prompting of the term \"insulin\". Again, it seems odd for Leonard to have this memory if his wife were not diabetic. The one that comes with the direct statement of her being diabetic (#3) is the one he most actively denies and the one Nolan even suggests through the \"pinching visualization\" that he is trying to actively deny and ignore it. It suggests the lying to himself, which we will be shown explicitly later that he does do. So since we know he does have memories of insulin injections with his wife, we can return to what should be the real questions:\n\nIf Leonard's wife was diabetic why does Leonard deny it? This one seems pretty clear from the film. Leonard does not want to realize that he killed his own wife. He seems to have misremembered the insulin OD as a Sammy memory and does not want to acknowledge the truth. The other question: \"If Leonard's wife was not diabetic why does Leonard have memories of her being diabetic?\" is something that does not seem to have an answer in the film or even through speculation. This lack of a reason makes it seem clear to many that Nolan's intent was to make us believe that Leonard's wife was diabetic. There is no reason why Leonard would have memories of a diabetic wife if she were not diabetic.\n\nThe question has also been raised at why we see only a small number of memories of a diabetic wife. We see only two memories on three occasions. If Leonard's wife were diabetic he would have years of memories, hundreds if not thousands of them. There is nothing to negate the possibility that Leonard has plenty of memories of his wife being diabetic. Just because we do not see every possible memory that Leonard may have of his life before the attack, does not mean he does not have the memories. The movie is edited. We do not see Leonard 24/7 and even then we do not see everything Leonard thinks about, nor do we hear constant voiceovers to explain things. Nolan indicates things and negates other things by the film. The film is a mystery, a puzzle, you must look at multiple clues to get an answer.\n\nWe are not even seeing random snippets of Leonard's life and memories. Nolan is choosing what he presents to us. He has chosen to not show us the other memories since his goal is to surprise us. He chooses to show us memories Leonard has of his wife that do not involve diabetes and he chooses to only show us three select times when Leonard does have the memory. One is a very small segment, intended to act as foreshadowing the other, the second a more complete memory of the small segment so we understand the significance and the third a separate memory. This technique serves a dual purpose: it keeps the surprise, but also demonstrates that Leonard does indeed remember his wife being diabetic which fills any hole suggesting he does not remember something so pervasive. Nolan indicates that Leonard does remember a diabetic wife. But it should also be clear that no matter how pervasive diabetes is, Leonard will still have memories of his wife that do not involve diabetes. Nolan chooses to show us more of these memories.\n\nIt has been suggested that the film implies that Leonard may also have retrograde amnesia. If we believe Teddy's version as the truth, then it could be interpreted that Leonard has forgotten that Sammy Jankis did not have a wife. But while it is actually common for people with anterograde amnesia to get some retrograde amnesia, it tends to block out a series of time of days to years. It would not manifest itself in being able to remember Sammy and not remember he did not have a wife. A more likely explanation is that he does \"remember\" Sammy having a wife due to the false memories that have been anchored to Sammy memories."], ["How many attackers were there? What happened to them?", "If one does not believe Teddy or is arguing about the reliability of Leonard's memory, the detectives who concluded that there was only one attacker may be correct and we can believe Leonard killed him. If one chooses to believe Leonard's account to Natalie, there were at least two attackers. Leonard shot one attacker in the head, and the other got away. If we presume that Teddy is telling the truth during the exposition, they were a \"couple of junkies too strung out to realize your wife didn't live alone\", and that Teddy was assigned to the case of his wife's death, and believed Leonard about there being a second attacker. He decided to help him find the second attacker (who they discover is a white male with first name of John and last name starting with a \"G\". Over a year before the events of the film, they find \"John G\" and Leonard kills him. Afterwards Leonard decides to continue hunting for a man he already killed, which leads us a year later to Leonard in the Discount Inn. If we presume that Teddy is lying, the film provides no suggestion or hint of who they might be or even if there was an attack at all."], ["Who killed Leonard's wife?", "This is a difficult question to answer, since we are not even sure of all the facts. She could have died in the attack, though it is also possible there was not an attack or that Leonard does not even have a wife. It is all a matter of what one takes as fact and what one concludes from that fact. There is also the exposition which indicates (and can be supported via the character's actions at the end) that Leonard's wife died from an insulin overdose. She survived the attack/rape and went on living her life, however, she could not deal with her husband's (Leonard's) condition. She wanted to kill herself and she used Leonard as a proxy. She set Leonard up to give her multiple shots, and died from the overdose. Even though it was a \"suicide by proxy\", both Teddy and Leonard believe that death was a result of the attack and thus the 2nd attacker is still culpable for her death."], ["\"Remember Sammy Jankis\". Is Sammy Leonard?", "There have been several debates about Sammy Jankis. The first of the tattoos shown in the movie is \"remember Sammy Jankis\". The tattoo seems to help Leonard focus on that time of his life and is part of Leonard's investigation \"system\". It is clear that, if we choose to believe Teddy at the end, Sammy was a real person since Teddy explicitly indicates that Sammy was a \"con-man\", \"a faker\", he did not say that \"Sammy did not exist\". In this scenario, Sammy is real and Leonard investigated him, but what Leonard says about Sammy is most likely a combination of real Sammy memories, items that combine elements of both Sammy and Leonard, elements of just Leonard items, and some confabulation. If we presume that Teddy is lying and not providing an exposition, it is not entirely clear. Most choose to think Teddy is lying and Leonard is telling the truth, suggesting that what Leonard says about Sammy is completely about Sammy.\n\nFor Sammy to not to have existed at all, actually not only requires us to not believe Teddy, but also requires that Leonard is faking. Someone with this condition could not \"create Sammy\" after getting this condition. The film seems to indicate that Leonard is not \"faking\". Even if the whole story of Sammy was a confabulation by Leonard, there is no way he could keep using the same name. Even the \"remember Sammy Jankis\" would be a constant confusing element for Leonard. He would continually wonder things like: \"Who is Sammy Jankis? I don't know a Sammy Jankis, Why am I supposed to remember him?\" If Sammy does not exist, it also means that Leonard had no reason to learn about this condition before the attack from investigating Sammy. So it raises the questions of how did he learn about it after the attack or why did he forget the reason he learned about it before the attack?\n\nThere is a sequence in the film where Sammy changes to Leonard in the mental hospital scene. It can be described as: (1) 01:29:22 [Black/White Scenes] We see the \"test\" with Sammy and his wife hear Leonard's voiceover: \"She went into a coma and never recovered. Sammy couldn't understand or explain what happened.\" (2) 01:29:30 We see Leonard on the phone and saying: \"He's been in a home ever since.\", (3) 01:29:32 We see Sammy in a Home and hear voiceover: \"He doesn't even know that his wife's dead.\" (4) 01:29:36 Leonard on phone: \"I was wrong about Sammy, and I was wrong about his wife. She wasn't interested in the money. She just needed to understand his problem.\" (5) 01:29:43 Sammy in Home, Leonard voiceover: \"His brain didn't respond to conditioning. But he wasn't a con man.\" (6) 01:29:47 Sammy in Home, Leonard voiceover: \"And when she looked into his eyes, she thought he could be the same person.\" (7) 01:29:50 Sammy in Home, person walking behind Sammy, Leonard voiceover: \"When I looked into his eyes, I thought I saw recognition.\" (8) 01:29:53 Leonard on phone: \"Now I know. You fake it. If you're supposed to recognize somebody, you just pretend to.\" (9) 01:29:58 Sammy in Home, person in front, Leonard in Home, Leonard voiceover: \"You bluff it to get a pat on the head from the doctors.\" (10) 01:30:01 Leonard on phone: \"You bluff it to seem less of a freak.\" (11) 01:30:07 Leonard on phone: \"What drug dealer?\" (12) 01:30:09 [Color Scene]Jaguar tires screeching in front of Emma's\n\nThis sequence seems to be either a suggestion that Leonard has projected some of his recollections onto Sammy (Teddy is truthful) or just a scene indicating how Leonard \"associates\" himself with Sammy's condition (Teddy is lying). There seems to be nothing to indicate a suggestion that they are the same person since if Teddy is lying we don't believe the Leonard's wife being diabetic and if Teddy is truthful, then Sammy is a faker with no wife and Leonard has a diabetic wife. For Sammy to be a faker, Teddy must be lying and also that Leonard's story can not be believed. This scene seems most likely to reflect a visual clue by Nolan as how Leonard may even \"project\" and \"misremember\" implicit recollections as explicit Sammy memories. The movie seems to suggest that the \"Sammy Story\" that Leonard tells is a mixture of real Sammy memories from Leonard, recollections of Leonard about things that happened to him as well as Sammy, projections of things that happened to Leonard but did not happen to Sammy and even some confabulation (common among people with memory problems) of things that Leonard makes up to fill in the gaps."], ["\"I've Done It\" Tattoo - is it real?", "There is a scene in the final part that Leonard is lying alongside his wife, with a tattoo of \"I've Done It\" on the chest. Based on the entire film the scene does not appear to be a \"flashback\" at all since the scene shows a tattoo \"I've Done It\" which he does not have at all in the film and in addition there is no sign that the tattoo was removed (and we do see a closeup of his chest). Since it is not a flashback, and it appears to be something in his mind that he is thinking about, it appears to be a fantasy / daydream / wish. It seems most likely that Leonard is driving and is looking for a tattoo parlor to tattoo fact 6, which he at this point believes is the 2nd attacker's license plate. He believes that he is close to finishing his quest and he daydreams an (ironic) fantasy: his quest fulfilled and his wife still alive. It is probably meant to be ironic, since without her death there would have been no quest. It is even hinted by the film that she could have been still alive if he had shown the drive he shows with the quest while she was alive. It is possible that the image is a clairvoyant vision of the future, but we see no indication that Leonard has any prescient visions elsewhere in the film, so this does not seem reasonable.\n\nIt has been suggested that the scene could be not a vision in Leonard's mind at all but just a \"future scene\" (a flash-forward). This does not seem likely unless Nolan and/or Dody Dorn made a huge mistake. If it were a future scene, then the scene should come before we see Teddy shot and there should be a black and white scene after it that takes place before the 2nd scene in the film. There should also be an \"overlapping\" segment at the beginning of it that matches the end of the Teddy being shot sequence (and in all likelihood, the Teddy being shot should not be in reverse, but that would just be another error made.) Supporting that it is meant to come from Leonard's mind and is not a shot mistakenly put here, is the foreshadowing of the shot several times earlier in the sequence, when we get short glimpses of the scene. [In support of the \"daydream\" interpretation is that, when the movie is watched in \"Chrono-order\" on the DVD, this scene still is shown in this location, it is not placed after Teddy is shot at the end of the chrono-version.]"], ["How did Leonard get the scratches on his face?", "Leonard got the scratches while fighting Jimmy Grantz.

The various styles most likely reflect a suggestion of different tattoo artists and possibly their own preferences. There has been some speculation on some meaning of \"remember Sammy Jankis\" being in a script face when the film shows Leonard using a different handwriting style for notes he questions.

Nothing is explicitly given in the movie to indicate how he got the name. There is also nothing in the info on website or supplemental DVD material which could be lead to that name (it does indicate he had it while he was in the mental institution). Most probably, it came about by the police files or his own and Teddy's investigation on the attack. [If we believe that the supplemental material on the website online and on some of the DVDs is \"canon\" then it appears he was convinced of the name before he escaped the mental institute. A doctor's report indicates: \"Leonard seems convinced that the police have overlooked a second man involved in incident in his house in which he was injured. Leonard identifies the man as John G.\"]\n\nIt is possible though not too probable that it was \"created\" by Leonard (or even Teddy, though it would be a little stupid for Teddy to give his own name as that of the rapist and eventually murderer they are looking for). This makes Teddy out to be a complete idiot. It is also possible that, at some point in the past, Leonard already got mad enough at Teddy to write down a part of his (real) name to later persuade himself that it was the name of the killer, just like he did with the license plate number in the film. This seem unlikely since again it makes Teddy out to be an idiot, since he would seem unaware to the fact that while he was feeding Leonard info, Leonard was coming up with his own clues which were pointing to Teddy."], ["What does Natalie want from Leonard?", "Natalie's attitude to Leonard changes throughout the story:\n1. She sees him wearing her boyfriend's clothes driving her boyfriend's car so she suspects him to have killed Jimmy.\n2. After the \"test\" in the bar she believes that Leonard is not responsible since he cannot remember anything anyway and decides to use Leonard and his condition to get rid of Dodd (who is after the money that is now actually safely in Leonard's possession) so she tries to (unsuccessfully) manipulate Leonard into killing Dodd.\n3. Eventually she takes pity on Leonard and wants to help him find the person responsible for his condition - by providing information on the license plate number he had tattooed on his leg."], ["Who is Leonard talking to on the phone?", "In some cases it is clear that Leonard is talking to the front desk (and at least one time it is Burt since Leonard says \"Burt\" as if the man on the phone indicated his name). The other times it is most likely Teddy; early in the film Leonard tells Burt to hold all his calls except Teddy's as an exception. Thus it appears to be Teddy who is telling Leonard that Jimmy Grantz is the 2nd attacker on the phone. Teddy does admit to doing this at the end of the film as well, supporting the conjecture that Teddy is on the phone."], ["If Leonard knew Teddy before, how come he has no picture of Teddy?", "Leonard may not have an earlier picture of Teddy, for a variety of reasons. It is not explicitly given, but here are some thoughts: (1) Teddy may be lying at the end of the film and they may have just first met in the lobby of the discount inn. Leonard would have no picture of Teddy since they never met. (2) Leonard may have destroyed it for some reason (we see Leonard destroy evidence near the end of the film). The reason(s) would be subject to anyone's speculation, since nothing is explicitly given in the film about it. (3) Teddy may have stolen it for some reason to make it seem like they just met. Again, the reason(s) would be subject to anyone's speculation, since nothing is explicitly given in the film about it. (4) Leonard may have lost it. The movie shows how easy it is for Leonard to lose and forget things: he almost forgot the driver's license information at the cafe. (5) Leonard could have already had a picture of someone labeled \"Teddy\" but since he was meeting someone named \"Officer Gammell\" he did not realize that the man he was meeting was \"Teddy\". When he looked through his \"archived photos\", he found none labeled \"Gammell\" (though could have seen one or more of \"Teddy\") and by the time he met \"Gammell\" in the lobby, he no longer remembered the photo and when he took the picture, he no longer remembered that he had seen one of \"Teddy\"."], ["Did Teddy manipulate Leonard to kill Jimmy? Why?", "If we do not believe Teddy's exposition, we don't know who may have setup Jimmy since we are never shown who is on the phone and Teddy admits to doing it. Some believe that Teddy is lying and character on the phone may neve be shown in the film or could be Dodd, Natalie, or always Burt and one of them setup Jimmy for a reason not disclosed in the film. If we believe Teddy in the exposition, it is quite obvious since Teddy he admits to doing it.\n\nWhy? In the conventional interpretation - that takes it that Teddy is speaking the truth in the key scene - Teddy has been trying to help Leonard get vengeance. After they successfully tracked the 2nd attacker and Leonard killed him, Teddy realized that the memory did not stick. Still wanting to see Leonard happy and hoping that he could convince him through repeatedly indicating the truth, he continued to help Leonard hunt for a man he already killed. After a year of hunting the same man, Teddy decided to find another victim (it is not stated in the movie what triggered this new killing). Teddy decides to setup a Jimmy Grantz. He has a near match in the name, is a drug dealer so he is not completely innocent of crime, and they can also make some money. But while there is motivation for money, possible motivation to kill drug dealers, the movie is relatively explicit: Teddy is trying to (and does succeed) to convince Leonard the quest is done. But we see that even though convinced, Leonard chooses to continue.The movie indicates that his motivation for doing this was to try and convince Leonard that the quest was done.\n\nIf Teddy's goal were to get Leonard to continue, there was no reason for Teddy to lie to Leonard and try to convince him that dead Jimmy was the 2nd attacker. Teddy lied and tried to convince Leonard even knowing that, at that time, Leonard did not believe that dead Jimmy was the 2nd attacker. If Teddy's goal were to convince Leonard to continue (instead of stopping) he could have told Leonard the truth: Jimmy was not the 2nd attacker, but that someone (he would not have to say who) used Leonard to kill the wrong man. All Teddy needed to do as tell the truth, tell Leonard he will fix things us and agree to meet Leonard later. This has the advantage of being true, Leonard already believes or suspects it, and it not only gets Leonard to leave so he can get the money, but it then allows Teddy to start setting up the next person. But Teddy does not try to convince Leonard that the quest is incomplete. He lies to convince Leonard that the quest is DONE. And when that doesn't work, he admits that Jimmy was not the 2nd attacker and then tries (and succeeds!) in convincing Leonard that the 2nd attacker was killed a year ago. So here we are shown at the end of the film Teddy trying twice to convince Leonard that that the 2nd attacker is dead and the quest is complete. And when Teddy succeeds in convincing Leonard, we are shown that Leonard is the one who consciously chooses to continue a hunt he is convinced is completed."], ["How long has Teddy been manipulating Leonard?", "This is a very difficult question to answer since we aren't explicitly told how long they have even know each other. The key point from the film is that through the majority of the film time (both event time and screen time) Leonard was manipulating himself. If we believe Teddy's exposition at the end of the film, they have know each other for over a year and Teddy manipulated Leonard to kill Jimmy recently, though did allow Leonard to continue to believe that the 2nd attacker was still alive. If we do not believe Teddy's exposition, they may have first met in the lobby of the Discount Inn or have known each other for decades."], ["How does Jimmy Grantz know Leonard?", "It is never explicitly stated in the film, but it is clear that they had met before: Jimmy appears to recognize Leonard when they first meet at the drug deal and associates him with Teddy (Jimmy sees Leonard and asks what Leonard is doing there and where Teddy is). Natalie indicates that her boyfriend (who is Jimmy) told her about a memory man. It is not unreasonable to presume that at some point, Teddy introduced Jimmy to Leonard. This would make sense for Teddy to do in his setup of Jimmy. Teddy was going to send Leonard to a drug deal so that Leonard would kill Jimmy. By introducing Jimmy to Leonard, Jimmy learns about Leonard's condition and believes him to be non-threatening. If Teddy had not introduced them, Jimmy would not know Leonard and is more likely to leave or attack Leonard for being at the scene of the crime. Teddy says that Jimmy dealt drugs out of the Discount Inn and that the guy at the front desk (Bert?) called him if anybody came snooping around. The guy called Jimmy when he saw Leonard taking a picture of \"the dump\". If this is to be believed then Jimmy would not have known Leonard, but known of him and would most likely have seen him at the Inn."], ["Why does Jimmy whisper \"Sammy\" when Leonard is dragging him downstairs?", "The movie is not explicit as to why, but it appears to be an attempt to try and convince Leonard that they have met before and that he is not who Leonard thinks he is. Whether this was its intent or not, it seems to work this way on Leonard as it does seem to convince Leonard that Jimmy was not the second attacker. It is too late to save Jimmy because he is dead by the time Leonard pieces this together. Some have speculated that Jimmy is already dead at this time and Leonard only hears it in his imagination. While it is possible that anything we see in the film may be in Leonard's imagination, there is nothing to suggest that only he heard it as the audience hears it (it is even on the subtitles and in the script as well) and the film also seems to show a shot of him breathing a few seconds before the shot of him whispering \"Sammy...\"\n\n"], ["How did Leonard know where Dodd was staying and where Natalie lived?", "Both of these pieces of information are stored on the note Leonard has about Dodd:DODD \nWhite guy, 6'2\", blonde \nMonteRest Inn on 5th St \nRoom 6 \nPut him onto Teddy \nOR just get RID \nOF him foR NAtAlie \n919 BOOTH ST."], ["Why are pages missing in the police report?", "The most likely reason suggested by the film is that Leonard removed the pages that would indicate things he does not want to believe, like things that (1) would remind him that it was he to have killed his wife, and (2) would be too specific about who John G is. This is supported by the fact that we are explicitly shown that Leonard destroys evidence (presumably of things he does not want to believe). We also see that Leonard is shown to choose to continue his quest (after he believes it is completed) and it is suggested that the quest is the only thing that gives sense and purpose to his existence. It is also possible that the someone else removed the pages for unknown reasons or that he got them incomplete though other than Leonard's speculation about this (with no data) there is no other suggestion of this in the film."], ["Why the second hotel room?", "Burt says that he told his boss about Leonard's condition, and the manager told him to try and rent him another room.

The most Leonard says on the subject is: \"I'd rather be mistaken for a dead guy than a killer.\" Speculations include (you can make up your own motives as well): (1)The clothes and car are so much nicer than his. If you are willing to kill someone: stealing is not really a \"crime\". Why not take the nicer objects? (2) It could be part of his \"routine\": Kill a man, take his clothes and car. The clothes he had on and the truck may be from the man he killed a year ago. (3) It could be that he wants to make the killer of his wife suffer even more, and takes his clothes as a way of humiliating him. Leonard takes the man's life--his clothes and car, which are wrapped up in his identity--just as the man took his. This idea seems to work with a theme in _Memento_ (qv) about \"Identity\" (especially mistaken identity). Natalie thinks Leonard is Jimmy, then thinks he is Teddy, then learns he is Leonard. Teddy is \"mistaken\" for the 2nd killer, Jimmy is \"mistaken\" for the 2nd killer.

But the film indicates that Leonard does not believe Teddy is the second attacker since Leonard admits to lying to himself about it to be happy. But whether this happiness is to have a purpose and goal in life as Teddy suggests in the exposition, or that Leonard is just happy to kill anyone, or some other speculation not raised by the film is open to interpretation. There has been some speculation that Leonard sets up Teddy to avenge Jimmy's death or out of anger for being manipulated, but others have pointed out that Leonard would not need to lie to himself to do this but could have just killed Teddy in moral outrage if that was his intent with no need to lie to himself at all. Another theory is that Leonard does not want to be reminded that he killed his wife and wants to eliminate Teddy to prevent this from happening again. Leonard says he is \"not a killer\", meaning that he does not have the kind of personality to cold-bloodedly pull the trigger and kill Teddy while knowing he is doing it for reasons other than to avenge his wife's death. He does however have the ability to set something in motion that will impel him to kill Teddy later, so he writes down the license plate number as a way to do that."], ["After Dodd blocks the jaguar in, how does Leonard escape?", "It is very possible that this is just a goof in the movie because at first it appears to some that we see Dodd's SUV block the Jaguar and afterwards, it seems to have moved forward so that it is no longer blocking it. [It seems to do this during the time that Dodd's SUV \"inexplicably\" turns into a truck and then turns back into the SUV, which is clearly a \"goof\".] But it could also just be a misperception that the Jaguar is actually blocked in by Dodd.

It would appear that Nolan did not consider this a very important detail in his overall narrative of the film, but we may speculate. There are several possibilities that come to mind. (1) At the end of the story it could very well still be in the trunk ready for Leonard to rediscover it and wonder where it came from. (2) Leonard could have during the course of the film already added it to whatever stash of money he has been using for expenses. (3) Teddy could have broken into the car and taken it at some time during the film. (4) It is even possible that Natalie could have used a spare key (it is not unlikely that a couple living together would each have a key to the vehicles), found the money and taken it."], ["Leonard's Finances: How much does he have, where from? How does he keep track?", "These types of questions come up periodically and any answer would have to be speculative since nothing explicit is given in the film and there is also very few implicit indicators. We know at one point, if Jimmy is not lying, that there was $200,000 in the trunk of the Jaguar. We see some of this money but can't verify the truth of what Jimmy said nor do we know what happened to it. At the end of the story is it still in the trunk? Did Leonard add it to whatever stash he has? Did Teddy take it? Did Natalie take it?\n\nWe just don't know, Nolan gives us no indication. He seems to have chosen to concentrate on the killings and less on these mundane aspects of his day-to-day existence. We also see Leonard only spend $40 in the entire timeframe of the movie (about 3 days) even though there are times when he would have spent money (pay the escort, pay Emma for the tattoo, etc). We do not even really get any indication of how he keeps track of money. He could have cleaned out any savings or checking account for the cash. We have no indication how much he may have had. He could even have gotten some from the second attacker a year ago. There is nothing to dispute this (though there is nothing to dispute other possibilities). We can speculate that he most likely uses cash, since he knows cops could trace checks, credit and debit cards. And there is nothing in the film to dispute this, either. And as for keeping track of his expenses, if we presume that it would make sense that he would have developed a system, we can presume he has a system and nothing disputes this either. One edited exchange does not show or dispute a system. We don't see Leonard take the money out of his wallet, nor do we see whether he made note of spending the money. Since we see no other transactions, we really have nothing to go on. We could presume that he has no method at all for keeping track of finances, and while there is nothing explicit to refute this, it seems to go against Leonard's character. Leonard seems to be intelligent enough to realize that he would need a financial system, so he most likely created one.\n\nOther than the $40 Leonard gave to Burt there are two other times finances are discussed. One time is when Teddy asks Leonard where he got the car and suit from. Leonard says that he has money. Teddy asks him from where, and it is seems clear that Leonard has no idea and he presumes it is from his wife's life insurance. It is clear that Leonard does not really know (and he shouldn't) since this came after he got this condition. Without looking at any notes he may have on the subject, Leonard would have no idea where his money came from. So this exchange gives no info on where or how much or anything, since Leonard does not look, and Teddy does not say.\n\nThe other exchange about finances is when Burt tells him to always get receipts. This seems clearly to be a joke (he smiles before saying it), and not advice, since Burt just said he has been ripping Leonard off. Leonard seems to take it as a joke with his sarcastic response of having to write it down. The exchange comes across that Leonard is probably always asking Burt for a receipt and Burt does anything in his power to distract him to forget about it. Burt seems so fascinated with Leonard's condition: always telling Leonard his name, acting like they have never met, so Leonard will explain it to him again. While the scene could indicate real advice from Burt, it would seem to indicate that Leonard is stupid and forgotten anything he knew about managing money that he may learned before the attack. This seems unlikely with this condition: Leonard would not lose his intelligence nor forget basic things he learned before. These facts make this presumption inconsistent with the film."], ["Is there a secondary meaning to Teddy's license plate?", "'Christopher Nolan' (qv) in one of the commentary tracks for the film comments on Teddy's license plate:This car license number \"SG13 7IU\", that's actually the zipcode of the school I attended.

And then later kind of liked the idea that maybe there would be someone out there that would be watching the film, back in England, and it would just seem familiar to them even though they had no idea that they were in any way connected with the people who made this film. And sure enough, since the film's come out, I've got quite a few sort of phone calls and emails from random people who attended the same school who were very surprised by that.What Nolan says is not completely accurate, however. The postcode for the school he attended, Haileybury in Hertford, is SG13 7NU. Teddy's license plate, SG13 7IU, is actually an invalid English postcode. The \"postcode area\" of SG is for Stevenage and the District \"SG13\" (as well as \"SG14\") is for Hertford. The postcode sector \"7\" does exist, but the postcode unit \"IU\" is invalid.The \"Inward code\" (7IU) while it has the correct form (a number followed by 2 letters) is invalid since it contains the letter \"I\" and the inward code never uses the letters C, I, K, M, O, or V."], ["What does the phrase \"Beer O'Clock\" mean?", "The character of Teddy indicates in the film: \"It's Beer O'Clock and I'm buying.\" Beer O'Clock is about 5 P.M., essentially the end of the normal workday.

Sternberg, Director of the Integrative Neural Immune Program at the National Institute of Mental Health identified the film as \"close to a perfect exploration of the neurobiology of memory.\" Writing in the journal Science, Sternberg concludes: \"This thought-provoking thriller is the kind of movie that keeps reverberating in the viewer's mind, and each iteration makes one examine preconceived notions in a different light. _Memento_ (qv) is a movie for anyone interested in the workings of memory and, indeed, in what it is that makes our own reality.\" [Sternberg, E.M (June 1, 2001). \"Piecing Together a Puzzling World: _Memento_ (qv)\". Science 292 (5522): 1661-1662.\n\nClinical neuropsychologist, Sallie Baxendale, writes in \"Memories aren't made of this: amnesia at the movies\": \"The overwhelming majority of amnesic characters in films bear little relation to any neurological or psychiatric realities of memory loss. However, three films deserve special consideration ... \"'_Memento_ (qv)' (2000) also deserves a special mention. Apparently inspired partly by the neuropsychological studies of the famous patient HM (who developed severe anterograde memory impairment after neurosurgery to control his epileptic seizures) and the temporal lobe amnesic syndrome, the film documents the difficulties faced by Leonard, who develops a severe anterograde amnesia after an attack in which his wife is killed. Unlike in most films in this genre, this amnesic character retains his identity, has little retrograde amnesia, and shows several of the severe everyday memory difficulties associated with the disorder. The fragmented, almost mosaic quality to the sequence of scenes in the film also cleverly reflects the \"perpetual present\" nature of the syndrome.\" In addition to \"_Memento_ (qv)\", _Finding Nemo_ (qv) and _S\u00e9 qui\u00e9n eres_ (qv) are the other 2 films Baxendale indicates are worth \"special mention\".\n\nA real life case of someone with this condition is Clive Wearing. A documentary on Clive is _The Man with the 7 Second Memory_ (qv) if anyone is interested in films about this condition. YouTube also has a couple of additional documentaries: THE MIND, 2nd EDITION. Life Without Memory: The Case of Clive Wearing (1999) Part 1a and Part 1b and THE MIND, 2nd EDITION. The Clive Wearing Story, Part 2: Living Without memory. Part 2a, Part 2b, Part 2c, and Part 2d. Clive's is much, much more severe than Leonard's (or most cases). Neuropsychologist, Dr. Barbara A. Wilson, OBE (Medical Research Center. Cambridge. England) has evaluated him on 15 occasions since 1985 (according to the documentary). \"Well, I think Clive Wearing is unique. I've never known another person so amnesiac as Clive. And I've probably seen about 700 brain injured people, most of them with memory impairment. He's definitely the most amnesiac person I've known...And even if he sees his own writing in his diaries or video tapes of himself, he acknowledges that its him on the video or him conducting or him writing, his handwriting, but says he wasn't conscious then. And the fact that he must have been conscious to have written or conducted, he won't accept it. Now that, I've never seen that in any other amnesiac people, even people with a very dense amnesia. They don't say 'I wasn't awake then' or 'I wasn't conscious then', so I feel that aspect of it is more than the memory impairment.\"\n\nThere are also several case studies in Oliver Sack's book: The Man who Mistook his Wife for a Hat. A good one is a chapter on a man named \"Jimmy G.\" who got it from chronic alcoholism (this is termed \"Korsakoff's syndrome\").\n\nThe \"classic example\" is a case study of a man called \"H.M.\" or \"Henry M.\" [after his death in 2008, the need for anonymity was gone and his name was revealed to be Henry Molaison].There is much online about him, google on anterograde amnesia \"H.M.\" to get a number of hits and information. H.M.'s was a \"pure case\" caused by surgery and not an accident. He had epileptic seizures and the doctors believed that if they removed some of his temporal lobe (including the hippocampus), then he would no longer get them. The doctors were correct: they cured him of his seizures! He also got this condition since (it was later discovered) that the hippocampus is important to the \"consolidation\" of memory (converting the short-term to long-term memory). Philip J. Hilts, published in 1995 by Simon & Schuster, wrote a biography of H.M. called \"Memory's Ghost: The Strange Tale of Mr. M. and the Nature of Memory\" which has some interesting comments about this condition, several passages of them relating strongly to things Leonard does in the film suggesting that Nolan must have done some \"homework\"."], ["Can people with AMD create new memories?", "Leonard makes a statement in the film that he can not create new memories. Some take this as literal truth of something we must believe and others have claimed it is a flaw on Nolan's part of the reality of this condition. The simplest explanation is that it is a \"simplification\" and an imprecision in what Leonard states. Most people do not nit-pick everything they say. [This is akin to Leonard saying he does not have \"amnesia\". He is simplifying for Burt: he means that he does not have \"retrograde amnesia\", which is what most people think of when they hear the term \"amnesia\". In reality, Leonard does have amnesia. Leonard has anterograde amnesia]. The movie clearly indicates that Leonard can create new procedural memories via habit and routine. In fact with this condition, implicit memory creation (procedural memories are only one type of implicit memory) is not affected at all, since it occurs through other parts of the brain. Therefore people with this condition are able to create new memories: implicit memory creation is completely unaffected.\n\nThe implication about this statement is not so much about the implicit memory creation that the movie discusses, but about the explicit memory creation. This condition causes an impairment in the ability of someone to create new explicit memories. But even this impairment is not absolute. Even some new explicit memories may be created: \"Amnesia is not an all-or-nothing condition, and even H.M., from time to time, has meagre conscious recollections of information encountered postoperatively\". H.M.'s was a \"pure case\" caused by surgery and not an accident. He had epileptic seizures and the doctors believed that if they removed some of his temporal lobe (including the hippocampus), then he would no longer get them. The doctors were correct: they cured him of his seizures! He also got this condition since (it was later discovered) that the hippocampus (more generally the MTL: media temporal lobe) is important to the \"consolidation\" of memory (converting the short-term to long-term memory).]\n\nNolan also suggests (provides us a clue to) this fact when he shows us a shot which may be interpreted of a memory of Leonard in a mental institute: a memory he could not have if the condition were absolute. It appears that Nolan does suggest how it is possible and why this type of memory is retained. The flash of Sammy turning into Leonard in the mental institute suggests to many a \"projection\" of Leonard recollections onto Sammy memories. The anchor of the recollection is the Sammy memory. It is important to realize, that this condition does not force Leonard to start with a \"clean state\". His memories are not \"erased\". The short term memories are just typically not consolidated into long-term memories. But, Leonard does have experiences after the attack and \"on some level\" bits are recalled: though maybe only subconsciously, and some relegated to show up only as \"conditioning\" (some probably to his surprise - when did I learn to do that?) other things only \"recalled\" as only distant memories. These are the implicit, non-declarative memories.\n\nFor example, in Oliver Sacks' book: The Man who Mistook his wife for a Hat, he has an entire chapter on a man named \"Jimmy G.\" who got this condition (anterograde memory dysfunction) from chronic alcoholism (this is termed \"Korsakoff's syndrome\"). Sacks states: \"He [Jimmie] sometimes retained faint memories, some dim echo or sense of familiarity. Thus five minutes after I had played tic-tac-toc [sic] with him, he recollected that \"some doctor\" had played this with him 'a while back' - whether the 'while back' was minutes or months ago he had no idea.\"\n\nAlso, this condition does allow you to learn thru conditioning (as mentioned many times in the movie), but some things may \"break thru\" that \"typically won't\". \"Jimmy G\" is also discussed online: \"Jimmy was stuck in the year 1945, it turned out. He only remembered one or two events since that year.

As stated this is enhanced by Leonard's knowledge of Sammy and his explicit memories of Sammy. It has been pointed out in the classic AMD case of H.M. that \"experiments demonstrate that H.M. is capable of learning some new factual information when it can be fixed to already acquired knowledge.\" This paper even the suggests that this can lead to false memories due to incorrect anchoring. H.M. seems to have anchored some of the Challenger explosion (which happened after his AMD) with his memories of the Titanic disaster. This type of misrembering seems to also be suggested in the film especially in the sequence of Sammy in a mental institute that turns into Leonard as someone nurse walks by."], ["Recommendation of Similar Films", "Periodically people request similar films to _Memento_ (qv).

The Region 1 US 2-disc Limited Edition has four different endings to the commentary track. (This seems to also be the same for the R2UK 3-disc edition, though it is not confirmed). You MUST have comments on \"COMMENTS\" from main screen and do NOT change the audio (LISTEN on main screen) when you make the transition right after Chapter 13 to get the alternate commentaries. You can display the current title/chapter to know which one you are on. The film is \"Title 1\" on the disc. At the end of Chapter 13 in this title (at ca 1:33:50 mark) the commentary/film will branch if you're listening to the commentary track (=soundtrack #4) at that moment. If you have changed the audio settings to listen to the OTHER soundtracks (DD 5.1, DD 2.0 or DTS 5.1), your commentary will not \"branch\" and you will continue to Chapter 14 of Title 1. If you turn the commentary on AFTER this branch point you will ALSO stay in Title 1. This commentary track AFTER chapter 13 plays normally until ca the 1:37:15 mark, when it will slow down and then reverse and run backwards and pretty much sound like gibberish. If you are listening to the commentary track as you cross the 1:33:50 mark, your player will randomly switch to title 2, 3 or 4, and it will stay with that one branch every time you go over the branch point until you eject and reload the disc. Then you can go to COMMENTS (to put on the comments) from the main menu, then CHAPTERS from the main menu, choose chapter 13, fast-forward to NEAR the end and let it play through the transition. Check the title-number to see what commentary you're listening to, and if it is one you've heard, STOP, EJECT and try again!\n\nEach of these titles contains the final three chapters of the film encoded with a different version of the commentary (ca the last 20 minutes, otherwise they are pretty much the same. Title 2 is the title 1 commentary without the reverse and backwards playing. It is like the rest of the commentary and deals with movie making and is pretty generic.

There is a different one in each column that gets to an item and if you read the actual words, it is relatively obvious (ie. \"WATCH in column 3 is to play the movie). The second disc has all the other goodies. It is set up like a psych exam - the main menu is the center of wheel and each of the answers moves you out from the center along \"spokes\". The cards with only opinions (along the spokes) do not affect where you go. When you get to a card with a \"puzzle\", answering the puzzle correctly gets you a \"special feature\". The puzzle with the tire changing pictures has 2 \"correct\" answers: the \"correct answer\" and the \"anti-correct\" (the answer in reverse), each will lead to a different feature. If you answer a puzzle incorrectly, you move off a spoke, heading around in a circle to a different spoke. The answers on this circle \"between spokes\" are opinion questions. The ones on the left take you \"counter-clockwise\" the ones on the right take you \"Clockwise\" towards the next spoke. The puzzles are not difficult, and they have made it especially easy that all the ones with A-E have \"C\" as the answer (for the most part just selecting \"C\" will navigate fine."], ["TimeLine and other hints from the website or DVD extras", "The movie does not explicitly indicate when the movie takes place. James Mottram in the book \"The Making of _Memento_ (qv)\", Faber and Faber, 2002, p. 147 indicates: \"For those interested, the action - barring flashbacks - takes place over three days and two nights.\" [Mottram discusses how it was essential for Cindy Evans, the costume designer, to have Nolan provide this information so she could determine the number of clothing changes a character would need and also to \"age them\" properly for the required scenes.] From the Official website and extras on some of the DVDs we can get additional information not in the film:\n\nI. The pre-history: The website is clear (if you want to believe that the items in there are \"canon\") that Leonard was in an institute. A timeline from the website info: The attack was Feb 24, 1997. [Website (HTML or Flash) or Copy of website on the DVD: Newspaper article - \"revenge\" first item is a \"Police Department death report\"]. Leonard's wife died Nov 1997 (probably before the 4th) [From copy of website on the DVD: newspaper article - \"Forgetful\" - 7th item is part of psych evaluation with the comment: \"he[Leonard] demanded to see his wife (deceased 11/97)\". He also has a note to himself (on website and DVD copy) newspaper article - \"Leonard\" 3rd item dated 11/4/97: \"She's gone, Leonard. Gone for good.\" [There also is a newspaper clipping (on DVD and both website versions: newspaper article - \"Leonard\" - first item) that indicates that his wife \"was listed in critical condition\". This is presumably the day after the attack]. Leonard's \"initial diagnosis\" at the institute was Jan 16, 1998 [Website (HTML or Flash) or Copy of website on the DVD: Newspaper article - \"forgetful\" - 6th item is his \"initial diagnosis\" with the date.] He escaped from the institute Sept 1998 [Website (HTML or Flash) or Copy of website on the DVD: the Newspaper article states this at the start of the 3rd column]. The movie takes place around Oct 25 1999 [Website (Flash) or Copy of website on the DVD: the Newspaper article - \"suspicious\" - 4th item is a \"police department officer's report\" on an interview with Emma the tattooist which has dates.] Leonard probably killed the first John G right after escaping (which was \"over a year ago\" as Teddy said in the film)\n\nII other clues: The website is clear: \"Shelby suffers from severe anterograde memory dysfunction as a result of head trauma sustained during confrontation with intruder (Feb '97). Shelby has recovered almost none of his ability to convert short-term experiences into long term memory\" [Newspaper article - \"forgetful\" - 5th item]. This indicates that Leonard is not faking and that he can convert some of his memories to long-term memory.\n\nIII. Teddy's license: (1) Name: John Edward Gammel, (2) City: San Francisco, and (3) Plate number: SG13-7IU (seven-i-u). Note the tattoo has 71U and the car changes from 7IU to 71U in the movie - a hint of how treacherous the memory is!"], ["Are there any differences between the various versions of the official website?", "There are 3 different versions of the \"Official\" _Memento_ (qv) website. On the online website there is a flash and an HTML version. On the R1US single-disc DVD there is a copy. [There is also a copy on the R2UK 3-disc DVD which is presumed to be the same as the US edition, but has not been confirmed by anyone]. All three start out with the \"_Memento_ (qv)\" scraps and the \"Some memories are best forgotten\" segments and go to a newspaper article which was presumably written after the events of the film (\"Photograph Sparks Murder Investigation\"). On the Flash/DVD (not on the HTML) version the last word \"Questions\" in the Subtitle is also a link. This link leads to a scrap of Paper that states \"WHO DID I KILL?\". In the Flash if you enter type in \"Teddy\" in the second scrap and click on it, you will get a short film of clips from the film. On the DVD, if you click on it you get a list of names and if you choose \"Teddy\" you will get credits for the DVD.\n\nAll three have links based on certain words:\nColumn 1\nParagraph 1: \"body\"\nParagraph 1: \"foul\"\nParagraph 2: \"suspicious\"\nColumn 2\nParagraph 2: \"Leonard\"\nParagraph 3: \"photographs\"\nColumn 3\nParagraph 5: \"forgetful\"\nParagraph 6: \"local\"\nParagraph 6: \"revenge\"\n\nThe body link takes you to the picture of dead Teddy. On the Flash version it changes to a shot of Leonard's wife taking a breath under the shower curtain and then back to the original. If selected on the DVD, the picture is changed to the Leonard's wife taking a breath and then back to Teddy's pic. The HTML just returns to the article. The foul link in all 3 versions has 4 items. In the Flash/DVD version the first one (the Dodd photo) transforms into the pointing Leonard photo. The suspicious link on the flash/DVD has 5 items and on the HTML there is only 4. The HTML does not have the \"Police Department\" report where an officer interviewed Emma. Like in the 2 previous words the first item on the Flash/DVD version transforms. It changes to a shot of Leonard creating tattoo fact 5 and then back again. The Leonard link has 4 items in all 3 versions. The first (a newspaper article about the attack) is transformed in the Flash/DVD version to show a closeup of Leonard's eye, then his wife taking a breath, then back to the article. The photographs link is much different in the Flash/DVD than in the HTML. The Flash/DVD have pictures of Marko, Noam, Teddy, David, Dodd. The Flash also ends with a picture of Miquel which the DVD does not have. Other than Teddy and Dodd, none of the pictures were props shown in the film.

For design information, please call (212) 750-0996 or email marko@webflowsolutions.com\". So Marko seems to be one of the designers.] The HTML version from the photographs link shows only photo props from the film: dead Teddy, Natalie, jaguar, Dodd,Teddy, truck, burned dead Jimmy pic, Discount Inn.\n\nThere are 11 items in the forgetful link. The 7th item in the DVD is slightly different from the current Flash/HTML version. It is a scrap of paper from a \"Clinical Record\" of Leonard's \"Initial diagnosis\". In the scrap there are a couple of paragraphs. At the end of the first paragraph in the Flash/HTML is the sentence: \"I asked if anything was bothering him and he demanded to see his wife (deceased).\" In the DVD version the same sentence states: \"I asked if anything was bothering him and he demanded to see his wife (deceased 11/97).\" The HTML version currently matches the Flash version, but before the summer of 2001 it matched the DVD. Sometime in the summer of 2001 it was changed online to match the Flash version. The local from the Flash/HTML versions are identical and contain 5 items. The DVD version contains only 4 items, the scrap of paper with the photocopy of Teddy's driver's license and the note from Natalie is not on the DVD. All versions have the same items from the revenge link. The order of the items on the HTML version of a couple of the items is different than on the Flash/DVD versions."], ["What happens after Leonard kills Teddy?", "Since the last event in the film's chronolgy is the death of Teddy, the film does not explicitly answer this question. There are several possibilities if one chooses to speculate. If Leonard does not get caught by the police he may: (1) choose to continue to hunt for the dead Teddy (choosing to ignore any evidence that Teddy is already dead, (2) choose to stop hunting believing that Teddy is the 2nd attacker, (3) delete or edit his current clues and begin to hunt other victims. If he does get caught by the police, he may: (1) be put into a more secure mental facility, (2)go to prison, (3) go to a facility for the criminally insane."], ["Was Teddy really a cop?", "Like most questions in this film, an explicit answer is never provided. At the end he briefly shows a badge to Leonard but Leonard doesn't seem to get enough of a look at it to confirm its authenticity. The movie mostly implies that he is, with only a few minor suggestions that he might not be. Teddy being the police officer that was assigned to Leonard's case would provide a reason as to why Teddy is in Leonard's life at all since it is obvious that he didn't know Teddy before the attack or he would remember him everytime he saw him and wouldn't need a picture of him. Teddy seems to know a lot about Leonard's police file which would support that he really was the cop assigned to Leonard's case. He also seems to know a lot about Jimmy Grantz and his dealings, something that would probably be considered easy information for a local police officer to obtain. However, at the end when Leonard meets Teddy in the lobby after the phone call, Teddy greets Leonard with the traditional \"Lenny!\" and when Leonard says \"Officer Gammel,\" Teddy suspiciously looks over at Burt, who wasn't paying attention, before confirming his identity and continuing outside. Also, when the two of them are in Dodd's hotel room and Leonard proposes that they force Dodd to leave town using a gun, Teddy replies, \"Why would I have a gun?\" when it is common for police officers to carry an off-duty weapon within their jurisdiction. Teddy's criminal motives (helping Leonard kill two people, taking drug money) may also support the idea that Teddy is not a cop, although it wouldn't be impossible to imagine a corrupt police officer doing the same thing. Teddy is revealed to have been lying about some things in this film along with several explanations given to Leonard about his motives that seem fishy so it wouldn't be completely unreasonable to think that Teddy might not actually be a cop."]], "0086250": [["A Note Regarding Spoilers", "The following FAQ entries may contain spoilers.

The original film, however, is set in Chicago during the era of Prohibition (the 30's) and features Itallian mobsters (not identified as Mafia per se)."], ["Is Tony attracted to his sister Gina?", "This film never goes into detail about this theme. Some people lean towards a yes, since the 1932 film portrays Tony as having feelings of incest for his sister. A logical answer would be that it is very unlikely that Tony is sexually attracted to Gina because in the film, Tony expresses interest in conceiving children with Elvira, telling her how beautiful he thinks she is and wanting to marry her. Most viewers agree that Tony is overprotective of Gina, refusing to let her have a boyfriend and threatening to kill anyone who expresses interest in her. At the end of the film Gina herself suggests Tony must indeed want her because he can't stand for another man to be with her. Tony has a genuine look of confusion on his face and even asks what she's talking about. Therefore he likely did not have sexual feelings towards her. Most likely he didn't want her to be around his kind of people, drug dealers, low-lifes, etc. but of course by trying his hardest to keep her away from such things, pushed her even closer to them. However numerous times in the film we see Tony almost leering at her in a way a brother would not normally act. It seems as though he IS attracted to his sister. When these feelings arise they anger and confuse Tony causing him to become violent numerous times; ie: shooting Manny and beating up Gina's boyfriend in the bathroom of the club. This combined with the fact that the original film displays similar themes does point to Tony's unhealthy attraction to Gina."], ["Why did Tony say his mother was dead when he was being interrogated at the beginning?", "Tony lied about his mother being dead because he knew that if he had told the immigration agents that his mother was alive and living in America, they would very likely have contacted her for information about Tony, and she would no doubt tell them what a bad person she thought he was, therefore refusing him entry into the United States."], ["Are there any video games based on this film?", "Yes.

Respect. for the Playstation Portable. In addition to those games, Grand Theft Auto: Vice City (2002) takes a lot of inspiration from the film. The look and feel of Vice City closely resembles Miami as it looks in the film. The city's nightclub--The Malibu Club--is almost identical to the club Tony visits, and the player can visit a hidden bathroom with blood on the wall next to the bathtub - an obvious reference to the chainsaw scene. Also the Diaz mansion that Tommy later inherits is obviously heavily inspired by Tonys mansion. The story incorporates a lot of features from the film (such as working your way to the top of the city's crime ranks, and even taking over a mansion from a former boss.

In the '83 film he's Tony Montana, a direct immigrant from Cuba.\n\n- In the '32 film Tony has a relatively close relationship with his mother and siblings, and people openly question his affections for his sister Francesca. In the '83 movie, Tony is estranged from his family, his mother despises him and he becomes close with his sister Gina. It is left ambiguous, however, as to whether he had sexual feelings for her.\n\n- In '32, Tony is a bootlegger of alcohol during prohibition in Chicago. In '83, Tony is a drug kingpin in Miami.\n\n- In both films, Tony steals his boss' girlfriend (Elvira in '83 and Poppy in '32), which prompts his boss (Frank in '83 and Johnny Lovo in '32) to try and have Tony killed.\n\n- Tony suspects but can't prove that his boss tried to kill him in both films, so he uses the same ploy to find out by having one of his men call the boss at his office and pretend to be the hitman. The boss' response gives away the fact that they did order the hit. The dialogue is similar in both movies.\n\n- In both movies, when Tony goes to claim his prize (being the boss' girl). He looks out the window and sees a sign that says \"the world is yours\". In the '32 movie, it is on a billboard. In the '83 movie it is on a passing blimp.\n\n- There is then a montage of Tony building his empire in both movies, though the '83 film spends much more time with Tony on top of the world. (As the movie's runtime is an hour longer than the '32 film)\n\n- In both movies Tony finds one of his trusted associates with his sister, at which point Tony snaps and kills him, only then discovering that they had just gotten married.\n\n- In the '32 film, Tony's sister gets over him murdering her husband very quickly and decides to help him make a stand against the police in Tony's second floor apartment hideout. She is shot through the window by the cops. In the '83 film Tony's sister becomes hysterical, starts shooting at Tony, and is gunned down by a hitman hiding on the balcony.\n\n- In the '32 film, Tony gets into a moderate shoot out with the police before surrendering. As he was walking down the stairs to meet the police, he decides to make a run for it and is shot repeatedly by the police. In the '83 film, Tony is not killed by the police or the feds, but by hit-men from a rival drug cartel. Fueled by rage and cocaine after seeing his sister killed, Tony gears up with his \"little friend\" and gets into one of the bloodiest and most classic shoot-outs in cinema history, killing or wounding more than a dozen Cartel hit-men before taking a double-barreled shotgun to the back by an assassin and falling into his reflection pool in his front lobby."], ["What are the differences between the old British BBFC 18 VHS and the Uncensored Version?", "Brian De Palma's action classic was cut for the VHS release by CIC and so was the First Edition by Universal.

In the first scene with Tony and Omar, when Manny introduces Tony, Omar offers them both a low-risk job of unloading marijuana from a boat for $500. Tony (clearly acting out of greed) balks at the offer and demands at least $1,000 for the work. The argument nearly turns violent when Omar prepares to pull a gun on Tony, when suddenly Waldo ('Santos Morales' (qv)) (the driver and other man in the car with Omar) stops him and whispers something to Omar which the tail end of it is heard as: \".... he can do the Colombians, man.\" This implies that Omar might have known about the mechanical nature of Hector the Toad (i.e.; rumors that Hector savagely kills people who attempt to buy his cocaine in order to steal their money). Waldo was clearly mentioning to Omar that he does not need to threaten Tony, but that if he arranges a cocaine purchase deal with Hector, it may result that Hector and his men would probably kill Tony for them."]], "0110357": [["A Note Regarding Spoilers", "The following FAQ entries may contain spoilers.

They confirmed that the story was influenced by the Shakespearean plays Hamlet and Richard III, the Biblical stories of Moses and Joseph, as well as by Disney classic _Bambi (1942)_ (qv)."], ["Why does Scar have a black mane?", "In the real lion world, male lions can have dark manes, some of them even turning black, due to age or genetics. However, Scar was Mufasa's younger brother, and Mufasa doesn't have a darker mane so most viewers conclude that Scar was given a black mane so as to distinguish him as the evil lion, rather like the bad cowboy always wearing a black hat. In actuality, Scar and Mufasa were not originally designed to be related. In early drafts of the script, Scar was a rogue lion and not Mufasa's brother. They look different because their relation was added later but their original designs were kept."], ["Why are there only two male lions amongst the large group of lionesses?", "Male lions maintain a pride of female lions, young males, and cubs. When the young males reach adulthood, they are chased out of the pride by the adult males. In each pride, it is the females who do the hunting, and they usually stay with their birth prides their whole lives. It is not uncommon for two males (who may or may not be related) to protect a pride. Some prides even have three or more males, in which case the males are almost always related or grew up together. Male lions without lionesses often form \"bachelor prides\" of about 3-5 and attempt to win lionesses from other males. In a real lion pride, Mufasa and Scar likely would have ruled equally."], ["How does the movie end?", "With help from Rafiki, Simba sees Mufasa in a vision. Mufasa convinces Simba to return to Pride Rock and take his place in the circle of life. Simba finds that the land is as Nala described it -- barren and black, thanks to Scar having turned it over to the hyenas. While Timon and Pumbaa distract the hyenas, Simba and Nala sneak past. Simba locates Scar and, while watching from behind a rock, Simba sees Scar reprimanding Sarabi for not bringing back any food. Angered when Scar slaps Sarabi, Simba orders Scar to step down, but Scar makes Simba reveal his role in causing Mufasa's death. Scar backs Simba against the cliff edge until Simba is hanging with only his front paws keeping him from falling into a fire that has been started below from a strike of lightning. Scar then boasts about how he did the same thing to Mufasa, causing him to fall to his death. Simba rallies his strength and leaps on Scar. The hyenas leap on Simba while the lionesses, led by Nala and Sarabi, leap on Scar. An all-out fight between lions and hyenas breaks out, resulting in Simba and Scar at each others' throats. The hyenas overhear Scar telling Simba that it was all the fault of the hyenas, so they turn on Scar, killing him. As rain starts to put out the fire, Simba hugs Rafiki and climbs to the top of Pride Rock where he lets out a loud roar. In the final scene, lushness has returned to the land and the herds have come back. Simba and Nala nuzzle each other, and Rafiki presents them with their new lion cub."], ["What is 'The Morning Report'?", "The Morning Report is a song that was featured in the Broadway version of _The Lion King_ (qv) but not included in the movie.

A detailed comparison between both versions with pictures can be found here."], ["Are there any substantial differences between the Broadway musical and the film's version of the story?", "Several, actually. Probably the biggest difference is that the character of Rafiki is changed to a female in the Broadway version. This is because the producers felt there weren't any truly strong female characters in the film. In the musical, most of the scenes are extended and new songs are added. For instance, young Simba and Nala running from the Hyenas is extended, with a new song called \"Chow Down\" inserted. Additionally, many of the songs from the film are reprised throughout the musical, including Be Prepared. Additionally, the Broadway version has entirely new scenes that never even took place in the film. Amongst these are a scene between Zazu and Mufasa, which implies Zazu was the majordomo to the previous king (Mufasa's father) and that young Mufasa ran off and got into trouble all the time, much like young Simba - this scene also features a humorous moment of Mufasa joking about firing Zazu. Another scene later on involves Scar trying to make Nala his queen, in an effort to gain more respect from the tribe. Some things are changed based on where the play is going on. For instance, when the play is shown in Vegas, Zazu sings an excerpt from Viva Las Vegas while locked in Scar's cage (he sang \"It's A Small World\" in the original film.)"]], "1291584": [["What is the song playing during the last scene of the movie?", "'About Today' by The National.

Burglars Billy McCarthy and Jimmy Miraglia (M & M) became targets of the Chicago Mob after committing a shooting in a known mob hangout that resulted in the deaths of two mob associates. Relying on information from Frank Cullotta, (an associate of M&M and a lifelong friend of Anthony Spilotro) McCarthy was snatched off the streets by Spilotro and noted hitmen Charles Nicoletti and Felix \"Milwaukee Phil\" Alderisio. They then proceeded to torture McCarthy to give up the name of his accomplice. After having his head placed in a vise by Spilotro, McCarthy gave up his accomplice Miraglia and was killed, with Miraglia's murder following later on.

A line to Colorado Springs was completed in 1888 and trackage rights to Denver was acquired in 1889. A line southwest across Kansas stretched to Tucumcari by the mid-1890s and a connection was completed with the Southern Pacific, thus completing the Pacific goal\" in 1901.

This takes place around the turn of the century (late 1890s fully automatic machine guns, and the Mexican soldiers are in khaki uniforms while the American soldiers are still in kersey blue.

Here are some descriptive references.\n\nPhase one: 1860-1871, Three men (two strikers and a drill holder) would be employed to prepare the blasting hole \"using an ordinary inch and one quarter drill.\" It would take a full shift for the three men to drill a sufficient number of holes which usually extended from 6-10 feet into the rock. Since the holes were rarely uniform, the blasting cartridges had to be made by hand. According to George Stuart,(19)9 a 19th-century mining entrepreneur, the cartridge shells were covered with thick brown paper and common soap was used to make them impervious to water. The shells were not only made to fill the holes as drilled but were adapted as well to the condition of the rock.(20)\nGeorge Stuart was associated with gold mining in Nova Scotia from the early 1860s until his death. He assisted his father in the construction of the first stamp mill at Waverley in the early 1860s. (From: G.

The breakdown will begin with the Jackson-Bill Carson narrative, with some sidebars added, followed by a strict timeline for the purists.\n\n(Background Info:) By the late 1840s, the tension in the United States between free and slave states was building to a boil. Each side in the controversy was fearful of the other getting an upper hand and the new territories in the West became pawns as to whether they would be free or slave. The South was interested in the territories seized from Mexico, the present Arizona, Utah and New Mexico and they believed also that a majority of the population of the southern portion of California was pro slavery. For a decade, Southerners promoting a southern Pacific railroad were particularly interested in New Mexico and they negotiated the Gadsden Purchase in 1853 (which at that time came to be known as Arizona, (more specifically, the southern area, Arizona didn't become a state until Feb 1912) solely with that in mind. New Mexico was key to Southern expansion and a port on the Pacific. Pro Southern sympathizers in the US Government proceeded to establish an almost \"U\" shaped overland communications and stagecoach route (The Butterfield Overland Stage Co.) from terminals in Missouri and Ft. Smith, Arkansas, swinging through Texas to El Paso and then utilizing a route through the recent Gadsden Purchase to Los Angeles then up to San Francisco rather than a more direct central route. The Mesilla Valley of the Rio Grande in New Mexico Territory formed the eastern extreme of that part of southern New Mexico called \"Arizona\" and contained two thirds of Arizona's population, most of them Mexicans, but the minority Americans were mostly from Texas and far more active and aggressive in dominating political affairs, and closely associated with staunchly pro-southern Texans living in and around El Paso. If ever an area epitomized lawlessness and wild frontier it was Western Arizona at the time of secession. Tucson was a place of resort for traders, speculators, gamblers, horse thieves, murderers, vagrant politicians, and a center of prostitution and crime. One critic observed that those that were not permitted to live in California found Tucson welcoming. Western Arizona was in a state of anarchy. The Tubac silver district area near Tucson and Pinos Altos near Mesilla were lively mining districts.\n\n1861: Soon after the start of the War Among the States, in late April or early May of 1861, a group of Southern patriots that include men with the names of Baker, and two friends Stevens and Jackson leave their West Texas homes and take the stage to Dallas where the Texas 3rd Cavalry is mustering. In early July the regiment leaves Dallas and heads for Missouri on the \"Texas Road\" through the Indian Territory to Ft. Smith, Arkansas. They participate in the battle of Wilson's Creek on August 10, 1861, CS casualties 1,095, US casualties 1,235 . The Regiment remains stationed in the border area of Missouri-Arkansas-Indian Territory. The 3rd Cavalry fights in the Battles of Chustenahlah on December 26, 1862.\n\nAt the end of January 1862, Jackson, Baker, and Stevens are detailed as a part of a 25-man Paymasters detachment for I Corps of the Trans-Mississippi District. Around the first of February, near Ft. Smith, they blunder into a Union Cavalry reconnaissance party. In the heat of battle the Paymasters wagon and $200,000 in gold coins disappears. The sole separated survivors, all wounded, are Jackson, Stevens, and Baker. At the beginning of the 2nd week of February back in Dallas a military tribunal conducts an inquiry and acquits both Jackson and Stevens. Stevens is discharged and immediately heads back to his El Paso, TX hacienda. Jackson, beginning to worry about being reassigned back to points further East, either changes his name to Bill Carson and telegraphs ahead to re-enlist in Sibley's Brigade, then hops a stage to El Paso, or Jackson, kills the real Bill Carson who is already on his way to join Sibley and assumes his identity.\n\nThe fact that Jackson has a snuff box embroidered with Bill Carson's name points to the latter scenario (he wouldn't have time to create an elaborate prop such as this), so in this latter scenario Jackson, after his acquittal, meets a dispatch-bearing corporal in Dallas on his way from Richmond to Sibley with orders to attach himself to the 7th Texas Cavalry (7th Mounted Volunteers) 3rd Regiment. The man is Jackson's age and build and Jackson decides to kill him and take over his identity and assignment. What better way to disappear. Jackson hops the stage to El Paso to catch up with Sibley's Brigade.\n\n(Sibley's Brigade or Army of New Mexico consisted of the Fourth Regiment Texas Mounted Rifles called the 1st Regiment, The Fifth Regiment Texas Mounted Rifles called the 2nd Regiment, and five companies (A,B,F,H,I) of the Seventh Regiment Texas Mounted Rifles known as the 3rd Regiment, and three independent companies of volunteers, the \"Arizona Rangers\", the \"Brigands\", and the \"San Elizario Spy Company\" in addition there was Teels Light Company B, First Texas Artillery (four cannons and eight howitzers) and a long supply train and thousands of draft and beef animals. All in all between 2,300 to 2,500 men. The Texans were armed with practically every type of firearm in existence: squirrel guns, bear guns, buffalo guns, single-barreled shotguns, double-barreled shotguns, navy revolvers, six shooters, etc.)\n\nA wounded Baker belatedly arrives back in Dallas and finds out that Jackson has completely vanished. Baker begins to suspect that Jackson along with Stevens has the missing gold. Baker heads back to El Paso and starts to threaten and torment Stevens as to the whereabouts of Jackson and the cash box. Getting no satisfaction, Baker hires Angel Eyes to find Jackson.\n\nJackson/Carson arrives in El Paso and attempts to find Maria, his \"soiled dove\" paramour. He is, however, unable to locate her and makes a tactical mistake, visiting Stevens to find out what he knows of her whereabouts. Stevens tells Jackson/Carson that he thinks she followed Colonel John Baylor's Second Regiment Texas Mounted Rifles up into the Mesilla Valley to ply her trade.\n\nJackson/Carson tells Stevens his new identity at the outside chance of his not finding her and Maria coming to Stevens and inquiring for him. Jackson/Carson heads north from El Paso after speaking to Half Soldier and he finds Maria in the New Mexico Territorial town of Santa (Dona) Ana. He spends the night and then follows Sibley's line of march up the Rio Grande.\n\nPart 2: Jackson/Carson reaches Paraje where he is warned by Confederate pickets to travel around Ft. Craig by night to avoid detection by Union \"spy\" Companies. He leaves the river and follows the road through the Journada del Muerto desert, a 100 mile short cut around the Union stronghold at Fort Craig. He rides at night and rests by day to avoid detection from the spy companies.\n\n(Independent \"Spy\" Companies were the eyes and ears of both Union and Confederate armies in the Southwest, for the Confederates Captain John Phillips \"Brigands\" known to the Texans as the \"Santa Fe Gamblers\" were a group of mountain men, gun fighters and Indian fighters, ne'er do wells, and general trouble making rowdies (originally from Santa Fe, hence their other name) but were recruited in the Mesilla Valley to act as scouts. For the Union Army, Captain James \"Paddy\" Graydon an Irish immigrant and ex-army officer/saloon keeper from the abandoned Ft. Buchanan \"Arizona\" vicinity started an Independent Spy Company working for Colonel Canby. Graydon hatched an interesting \"raid\" on the Texan Camp the evening before the Battle of Valverde. With Canby's permission Graydon packed a dozen 24 pound Howitzer shells in two boxes and after packing then on to the backs of two worn out old mules. He, with three or four of his men, crossed the Rio Grande at Ft. Craig under the cover of darkness and crept up to the Texan Camp. When they were about 500 feet from the Confederates, they lit the fuses and drove the mules towards the Texan mule herd, and hastily retreated. They figured they would trot over and join their mule brethren. Looking back, Graydon and his men were horrified to see that instead of heading over to the tethered herd the two mules were following them! The two explosions sent the Confederate Camp into an uproar, and it also resulted in several hundred very thirsty Confederate mules breaking loose and they, smelling water, headed off in a stampede to the Rio Grande where Union pickets collected them through the rest of the night. The result in the loss of mounts and teams caused the Fourth Texas Regiment to be converted into infantry and Sibley had to abandon 30 wagons containing tents, blankets, and papers of the Regiment.)\n\nBack to Jackson/Carson he reaches the North end of the Journada, passes Sibley's abandoned wagons, and re-crosses the Rio Grande at the Valverde ford observing the detriments of the recent carnage of battle (Valverde Ford Feb 21). On or about February 25th, south of Socorro near the Stapleton Ranch, New Mexico, Territory Jackson/Carson reaches the rear guard of Sibley's Brigade deposits his dispatches and joins the 7th Texas Cavalry (7th Mounted Volunteers) 3rd Regiment under the command of Powhatan Jordan. Sibley's Army of New Mexico takes Albuquerque on March 8th and Santa Fe on March 13th.\n\nOn March 21st, Jackson/Carson in a battalion of the 7th commanded by Powhatan Jordan along with the Fourth Regiment under the overall command of Colonel Scurry headed north from Albuquerque by way of the Galisteo Road. On March 24 they made it to the village of Real de Delores, that had a gold&silver smelter and ore diggings at the bases of nearby mountains, on the 26th the 7th arrives in Galisteo. A dispatch rider appears from Major Pyron disclosing that he was in a sharp conflict with a superior enemy sixteen miles away in Apache Canyon. At sunset the troops march off directly across the mountains on a bitter cold night in some places the snow was ankle deep. At 3 o'clock in the morning Scurry reached Pryon's encampment.\n\nMarch 28th at Pigeons ranch the Battle of Glorieta Pass was fought, the field of battle at the end of the day was in possession of the Confederates but the Confederate supply trains were completely destroyed by Chivington, Sibley's invasion plan is equally and effectively killed. Jackson/Carson is wounded badly in the battle and is brought back to Albuquerque with the rest of the wounded men of the 7th.\n\nOn April 6th and 7th, Sibley now totally discredited and disparaged by his army is known to his troops as a \"walking whiskey barrel\", with no supplies to sustain his army is forced to retreat from Santa Fe. At Albuquerque he splits his forces in two each traveling down the East and West sides of the Rio Grande. At the village of Perlata, Canby attacks the East side Confederate column under Green and during the skirmish a few wagons and an ambulance carrying Jackson/Carson is separated from the main column and continues down the East side of the river.\n\nThe small train and its occupants reach the north end of the Journada Del Muerta and enter the desert. Somewhere south of Ft. Craig the wagons and ambulance are attacked by a small \"spy\" company. During a running fight the wagons separate from the ambulance, and though the men in the ambulance kill or wound all of the spy company pursuers all in the ambulance are critically wounded and the panicked team of the ambulance bolts off to the south out of control.\n\n* Sibley was never present at any of the battles his Army of New Mexico participated in. He was always \"under the weather\" i.e. drunk in his \"ambulance\".\n\nPart 3: From the clues we get in the film we can surmise that Angel Eyes is a competent hired gun of some high repute who \"always gets the job done\" and that he has been in operation in West Texas, Mexico, New Mexico and \"Arizona\". I include Arizona because its the most lawless and plausible area where Angel Eyes, Tuco and Blondie would probably have been operating and the most likely area where they would have seen or met up with him prior to the events depicted in GBU. As I mentioned above it was the most lawless and remote area in the Southwest at the time, El Paso and Mesilla being slightly more civilized.\n\nEarly March 1862: Baker, back in El Paso, hires the notorious Angel Eyes to find Jackson and kill Stevens.\n\nMid-March 1862: Angel Eyes (AE) rides out to the Stevens hacienda, he questions Stevens and discovers through intimidation the fact that Jackson changed his name to Bill Carson and that he joined Sibley's Brigade. Stevens also inadvertently spills the beans about the missing cash box. Stevens gives AE $1000 dollars to try and buy off his life, and for AE to kill Baker to boot, but AE always finishing his job kills Stevens and one of his sons. AE goes back to Baker and collects his money and kills him. AE is now on a personal hunt for Carson and $200,000.\n\nIn El Paso as AE watches the second hanging of Tuco \"The Rat\" Ramirez, he questions \"Half Soldier\" (who was in the 3rd Texas Cavalry and lost both legs at the Battle of Wilson's Creek ) about the whereabouts of Bill Carson. Half Soldier also tells AE that Carson re-enlisted, and that he lost an eye, and that AE can find out more information from the whore Maria in the town of Santa Ana ( perhaps actually Dona Ana). Maria talks.\n\nEnd of March 1862: AE is at Ft. Marcy converted into a makeshift hospital outside of Santa Fe, New Mexico Territory (the other two Confederate hospitals were in Albuquerque, and Socorro). He finds out that Canby and the Union Forces have cut the Confederates to pieces at the Battles of Apache Canyon and Glorieta. If Carson is taken alive as a prisoner he will be sent to Batterville Camp (900 miles East). AE leaves for Batterville along the Santa Fe Trail, traveling at an average of 30 miles a day he reaches the vicinity of Batterville in a month. (What makes the most sense is for Batterville to be near Ft. Leavenworth, Kansas; as well as St. Joseph, Missouri. Historically the closest Union POW Camp was in Illinois but this early in the war prisoners were actually most likely pardoned.)\n\nMid-May 1862: AE waylays a Union Sergeant newly assigned to the camp assumes his identity, and awaits the possible arrival of Bill Carson while running a black market ring at the camp.\n\nTuco's Timeline\n\nOf Tuco Benedicto Juan Pacifico Ramierez, we can surmise quite a bit about since his character in GBU reveals the most back story. Between the litany of crimes read at his hangings to his reunion with his brother Pablo his life can be pretty much mapped out. A good subject for another post.\n\nDecember 1861: Tuco hides out in one of the boom&bust ghost towns that always dot the landscape in a volatile mining district in the Pinos Alto-Silver City area in the Black Range of New Mexico west of the Mesilla Valley. Hes tracked down and attacked by three bounty hunters, he kills two and wounds one. On his escape route out, three more bounty hunters shoot him off his horse. Tuco is \"saved\" by Blondie. If we go by fragmented clues provided by the film, and say Blondie was about 35 years in age, and then take into account his crack shot prowess with all firearms, his knowledge of military ordinance, and his ability to easily navigate about and survive in the harsh desert wilderness. And then if we can assume that if Blondie was telling the truth when he told the Union officer at the bridge that he was from Illinois we can probably assume that Blondie was involved in the Mexican War in 1846-1848.\n\nThe scenario would go something like this; born in Illinois, his family decides to emigrate to the West, while in Missouri/Kansas border area at age 16, Blondie enlists in the army, most likely a dragoon company. He goes with General Kearney on his march down the Santa Fe trail to New Mexico and points South & West. This would be a most likely back story if you take into account all the similar narratives of the men who roamed that area of the West, and explain how he acquired all his abilities, skills and knowledge. This scenario would put him in the right place and at the right time and since he has run into Angle Eyes before it would have been in the stretch of Southwest between Yuma and Mesilla called \"Arizona.\" I would also go as far as to say that a similar Mexican War scenario could be applied to AE.)\n\nBack to the GBU timeline\n\nBlondie's con game with Tuco begins. Blondie takes Tuco into Socorro, Texas, and collects the bounty. Before Tuco is hanged, Blondie shoots the rope and they escape North out of town and into New Mexico territory to lay low until things cool off for a while.\n\nPart 4: Here occurs the first major time jump in the film.\n\nMid-March 1862: El Paso, second Tuco hanging (observed by AE). Blondie and Tuco (B&T) escape again north into New Mexico Territory. Blondie severs relationship, takes Tuco's half of the reward and leaves him 70 miles out in the middle of nowhere. Tuco heads to the town of Dona Ana, New Mexico Territory, arriving in the early evening terribly dehydrated. He rearms at the local general store. Tuco, recovered, goes back to one of his abandoned mine hideouts and recruits some of his old henchmen from the Pinos Altos mining district to track down Blondie.\n\nSecond Time Jump\n\nApril 7th, 1862: Santa Fe, New Mexico Territory, Sibley's Brigade is retreating through town at the head are three bearded scouts, members of the \"Brigands\" or \"Santa Fe Gamblers\" a notorious independent company composed of trouble makers, ne'er-do-wells, and back country mountain men. Tuco spies Blondie's saddle rig and horse. Blondie kills the three men that Tuco has recruited, but is caught by Tuco. Blondie, about to be hanged in his hotel room by Tuco, is saved by a cannon shot from an artillery barrage that blows out the floor under Tuco. (This incident of the Union Army shelling a town actually happened in New Mexico and the women of the town went to the Union commander and told him that his shells were destroying their houses, so they actually stopped the bombardment.) Blondie escapes back to Texas (250 miles, give or take) for about 6 days' travel.\n\nSecond week of April 1862: The Socorro, New Mexico Territory sequence (fits in here). Tuco tracks Blondie South back down to Texas by following his campfires. Three campfires (50 miles a day more or less). The scene where he finds the cigars, the last one still smoldering and smokeable, indicates he's very close to finding Blondie.\n\nApril 15th, 1862: Blondie and Shorty this time are running the con game again in San Elizario, Texas. Tuco captures Blondie, preventing him from rescuing his friend, Shorty. Tuco marches Blondie north back into New Mexico planning a special surprise for his friend.\n\nApril 17th, 1862: Tuco gets supplies (food, water, water basin, parasol) in Dona Ana and marches Blondie into the \"Journada del Muerta\" (March of Death) desert, 100 miles stretching North to South with no water. B&T meet \"The Carriage of the Spirits\" (an ambushed Confederate 3rd regiment Headquarters Ambulance wagon full of bodies). Tuco begins to rob the dead but discovers Bill Carson/Jackson barely alive. A delirious Carson/Jackson tells Tuco about the buried gold in the Sad Hill Cemetery, Tuco asks about the name on the grave, but Bill Carson/Jackson begins to go into convulsions and demands water. Bill Carson/Jackson dies but tells Blondie the name on the grave. Tuco now must save Blondie, so he loads him in the ambulance and heads for help.\n\nApril 18th, 1862: B&T arrive at night at Confederate Picket Post probably near Paraje and find out they are at a place called Apache Canyon. Tuco asks for the closest infirmary and finds out that he is near his brothers San Antonio Mission hospital.\n\nApril 19th, 1862: B&T arrive at San Antonio Mission. Blondie recovers at the mission, under Tuco's watchful eyes.\n\nThird Time Jump\n\nMay 1862: B&T leave San Antonio Mission cross the Rio Grande at Paraje Ford and head North into the dry Plains of San Augustine passing around the Union stronghold of Ft. Craig. Tuco has a map and talks about heading Northwest and the Sierra Magdalena on their left and about crossing back across the Rio Grande and then going all the way across Texas (to the East). B&T are captured by James \"Paddy\" Graydons Independent Spy Company on a patrol following the retreating Sibley, North and West of Ft. Craig. (This scout of Graydon's really occurred. They picked up numerous stragglers, found buried supplies and cannon, many vulture picked over bodies, so the guy slapping his gloves to brush the dust off his uniform in the film was most likely Graydon.)\n\nFourth Time Jump (from here to the end of the film its pure fiction, Leone gave one clue in an interview saying the battle of Langston Bridge was envisioned as taking place further East not in New Mexico)\n\nJuly 1862: B&T marched into Batterville Camp, from Ft. Craig, 1,020 miles (at a pace of about 20 or so miles a day, over the Santa Fe trail. It would have taken them about 50 days) to this fictitious camp (again, the closest real Union POW camp was in Illinois). This site also is located near the longest railroad existing at the time (St. Joseph and Hannibal RR) west of the Mississippi. Tuco is tortured and tells AE that Sad Hill near Ft. Smith Arkansas is the name of the cemetery. Tuco and Wallace to St. Joseph and Hannibal RR. After ten hours on the train Tuco escapes and catches the next train back. Tuco tracks AE and Blondie South towards Ft. Smith, and Sad Hill. AE, Blondie & AE's gang (traveling about 30 miles per day) and Tuco (traveling about 40 miles per day) both reach Ft. Smith at the same time. (Ft. Smith, Arkansas changed hands several times during the Civil War and makes a good candidate for the battered town on a major river the Arkansas.) Tuco kills one armed bounty hunter who has been on the lookout for him for eight months. B&T kill AEs gang and head for Sad Hill.\n\n2nd week in July 1862: B&T blunder upon a battle for Langston or Langstone bridge over the Arkansas River. The small cemetery nearby at Sad Hill has swollen with the dead from the various skirmishes & battles in the border area of Northwest Arkansas ( Pea Ridge (Elkhorn Tavern) was on March 6-8th 1862, US Casualties 1, 349, CS Casualties 4,600). B&T and AE shoot out at Sad Hill.\n\nList of various sources for those wishing to read more: \"Sibley's New Mexico Campaign\" by Martin Hardwick Hall\n\"The Civil War In The American West\" by Alvin A.

Considering that it is $200,000 in gold, we will calculate it using the price of gold. Assuming the movie takes place in 1862 as shown in the above question, the price of gold per ounce in 1862 was $27.35. That would mean that the $200,000 would be 7,312.614 ounces of gold. Then using the price today per ounce (as of January 9th, 2012: $1,608.69) multiplied by the 7,312 ounces would give today's price of the same gold at $11,763,729.02.

The coins were worth more than the gold from which they were made. We can compare pay for equivalent work in order to come up with a ratio of value. A Union private during the ACW earned $13 per month or $152 per year. A private soldier in the US military today earns about $20,000 per year. Dividing 20,000 by 152 gives us a value ratio of 131.6 and then multiplying $200,000 by 131.6 places a modern day value for those coins at $26,320,000."], ["How near the end of the film, when Blondie is with Angel Eyes and his gang, does he realise that Tuco is nearby. He says the line \"Every gun makes its own tune...\"", "Tuco always shot with the same cadence/pattern/tune The \"tune\" almost certainly refers to Tuco's characteristic pattern of firing. He fires five shots in rapid succession, then, after a pause, the sixth shot. This 5:1 pattern is emphasized in the original Italian script, but it was not strictly adhered to during shooting. For example, at the gun shop, he fires at the Native American target figures 5 times, then after a pause, the sixth shot. Also, he should have shot Blondie's water canister 5 times, then a sixth shot. He also should have shot Al Mulloch 5 times, then stood up and released the final shot. Blondie hears: bang, bang, bang, bang, bang\u2014long pause\u2014then bang. And thus he recognizes Tuco. This gives him a chance to slip by Angel Eye's men and team up with Tuco to slightly even the odds in the battle with Angel Eyes. And Blondie doesn't actually say \"Every gun has it's own tune...\". This is what Mickey Knox came up with for the looping dialog after there was a flub in the sound effects on the English language print, what was actually filmed was when Clint is with Angel Eyes and is playing with the kitty is \"Five to one makes it easy. That's a perfect number large one\" which was dubbed to \"Every gun makes it's own tune, and it's perfect timing large one\"\n\nThis line is slightly different in the italian and french versions.\nFrench: \"Chaque arme a une voix bien \u00e0 elle. Et cette voix-l\u00e0 je la connais bien\" which literally means \"Each weapon has its own voice. And this voice is well known to me\". Italian: \"Ogni pistola a la sua voce. E questa la conosco\" which literally means \"Each weapon has its own voice. And I know this one\". Both clearly state Blondie has recognized Tuco's way of firing.\n\nExamples: While practicing in back of the gun shop he rapid fires off 5 shots, then there is about a 7-second delay and then a 6th shot. During the bathtub scene, he rapid fires off 4 shots then about 7 seconds later a 5th. However, if you review this scene frame-by-frame and listen to the gunshots, one gunshot is not heard. It's missing. It is the gunshot flash in frame #5. Watch it, and you will see the flash! Tuco actually fires off 5 in rapid succession followed by a 7 second delay and then the 6th shot, (now the second time he does this shooting pattern in the movie) this now makes Blondie original statement \"Five to one makes it easy. That's a perfect number large one\" valid; meaning maybe \"5 quick shots followed by 1\" making it \"easy\" to identify the shooter; this 5-to-1 sequence a \"perfect number\" indicating only Tuco. Maybe because of an audio edit mistake, because one gunshot sound is missing Knox's substitute and dubbed-over dialog \"Every gun makes it's own tune, and it's perfect timing large one\" almost with the same meaning without the numbering reference. They could have dubbed in another gunshot sound, but the original 5-to-1 statement is confusing and probably would have needed a little more explanation.

It was never directly stated that the $1000 Stevens gave him was to kill Baker. In fact, Stevens was probably offering it as a bribe for himself not to be killed. Angel Eyes uses the $1000 as an excuse to kill Baker (\"I think his idea was that I kill you\") and seek the $200,000 on his own. Had Baker been more fair and given Angel Eyes what he deserved for the information, he still would have died; after all, Angel Eyes is the \"Bad\" in GBU."]], "0093779": [["A Note Regarding Spoilers", "The following FAQ entries may contain spoilers.

The book contains more background on the characters, particularly histories of Inigo Montoya and Fezzik before they join Vizzini. It also contains a much lengthier segment when Fezzik and Inigo break into Count Rugen's torture chamber. In addition, it contains a sequence where Miracle Max ('Billy Crystal' (qv)) makes the two go on a series of quests to obtain the ingredients for the resurrection pill. The framing device of the Grandfather reading the story to his Grandson is also less prominent in the book. The book, which claims to be Goldman's edited version of the S. Morgenstern original, includes a significant amount of commentary, similar to a DVD commentary track, from Goldman. This commentary details, among other things, Goldman's relationship with the book, which he claims was read to him as a child and which he read to his own fictitious son. One, somewhat significant change in Inigo's motivation is that in the film Inigo's father refuses to sell the Six Fingered Man the sword because the Six Fingered Man offers too low a sum. In the book he refuses to sell because the Six Fingered Man insults the quality of the sword. Buttercup's motivation is very different in the book. She agrees to be Humperdinck's bride because it's better to be rich and alive than penniless and dead. She returns to Humperdinck after the Fire Swamp because she would rather live than die. (\"I can live without love\" are her exact words.) In the movie she is a much more sympathetic and intelligent character; in the book she is described as rather simple and self-serving."]], "0119698": [["A Note Regarding Spoilers", "The following FAQ entries may contain spoilers.

Miyazaki chose this era since the relationship between the Japanese and nature changed greatly around that time. During the Muromachi Era, iron production jumped, which required great numbers of trees to be cut down (for charcoal), and people came to feel that they could control nature. Also, it was the time before Japan as we know it was formed. It was a confusing, yet lively era. Women had more freedom, and a lot of new arts were born.

The ship's bosun provided practical lessons in dirty fighting. Eighteen months after leaving Gotham, Bruce was starving in the African market where he first steals for food. The next day, Bruce got himself hired by a tramp steamer and in the following months saw a lot of Africa and some of Asia. He jumped ship in Marrakesh, slept under a bridge for a couple of nights, and signed onto a tanker bound for the United Kingdom.\n\nHe hung around London long enough to learn something about stealing cars from the ship's cook, then shipped out on a freighter and found himself in Shanghai. One of the deckhands from his last ship had a way to make some quick, easy money, and Bruce was interested. The hijacking in the movie took place in Shanghai. However, according to the novelization, Bruce was actually sent to prison for something else, an unspecified illegal operation in Bhutan. This is where Bruce was imprisoned when he met Ducard.

Many drugs are effectively deactivated by the digestive system, requiring that they be administered intravenously or via absorption through the lining of the nose, which places it directly into the bloodstream, bypassing the digestive tract or following the normal path that oxygen does when it's inhaled into a person's lungs."], ["Would there be any instances of the spiked water supply affecting people before the microwave emitter was active?", "This subject was actually touched upon in the video game adaptation of the movie, where characters would talk about seeing strange things, etc. and Batman would actually use this to his advantage. Any instance where someone was inhaling water vapor could have caused people to start feeling the effects, such as having a hot shower, boiling a pot of water, tea kettle, etc..

If the latter is the case, it might well have killed anyone below the train as it moved across town, though this is never shown. (2) Water inside the human body is not simply liquid stored in a continuous pool; it is compartmentalized and contains a plethora of organic substances, such as large molecules, complex proteins and even entire cells (red blood cells, immune cells, etc.). Perhaps these, as well as cell membranes/organs protect the water in the body from evaporating by absorbing the microwaves, or in some way increasing the bonds between the water molecules strong enough to prevent them from evaporating. In any way, the device would then only affect pools of water with relatively low osmotic pressure, such as water supplies and sewers."], ["Was Commissioner Loeb corrupt?", "There were no indications that Loeb was corrupt, although his comic book counterpart was.

Gordon's dialogue in that scene indicates that there is no point in him reporting Flass anyway, at least suggesting that corruption within the department goes all the way to the top, i.e.: to Commissioner Loeb. However, since Loeb is still the Commissioner in The Dark Knight, and is never actually depicted as being corrupt, this may simply mean that he either turns a blind eye to the corruption of others or refuses to accept the extent of corruption in the department for political reasons. Gordon being partnered with Flass would also suggest that corruption is rife within the GCPD, since Gordon apparently sees no point in switching one corrupt partner for another. However, in his conversation with Bruce Wayne early in the film, Carmine Falcone explicitly states that the mob actually rules Gotham by intimidation, so perhaps the average GCPD officer is simply afraid to carry out his duties properly. This fits the depiction of Gotham's cops in The Dark Knight, most of whom are uncommitted time servers, more interested in going home alive at the end of their shifts than potentially sacrificing themselves in the line of duty."], ["How did Ra's Al Ghul learn that Bruce Wayne is Batman?", "Ducard/Ra's Al Ghul trained Bruce Wayne in combat, ninjutsu, and explained how theatricality and deception were powerful agents to the League of Shadows against their enemies.

The beaches at Normandy were further divided into \"sectors\" for specific units to approach; Miller and his team land at \"Dog Green\" Sector where some of the fiercest fighting occurred.."], ["What did Capt. Miller mean when he told his men to \"clear those murder holes!\"?", "He was talking about the opening at the front of the amphibious vehicle that would be formed when the landing ramp dropped. As we see several times during the landing, the German soldiers were given an easy target when the ramps opened. As a result, many of the men, Miller included, tried to exit the vehicle by jumping over the sides and into the water."], ["Why does Horvath say \"Captain, if your mother saw you do that she'd be very upset!\" to Miller?", "He says this because, when sending Jackson to fire on the machine gun nest, Miller distracts the gunners by temporarily exposing himself and shouting an order to draw the machine-gunner's fire."], ["Why does Mellish cry when he is handed a \"Hitler Youth Knife\"?", "Mellish is Jewish (this is evidenced by the fact that he has a Star of David attached to his dog tags throughout the movie and in a later scene where Mellish shows this Star of David to a line of captured Nazis and repeats \"Juden\" (German for 'Jews') over and over). While the war has not been mainly about the wholesale murder of his people but the aggressive expansion of Germany, the Jews were the ones who have suffered the most. He has just been through a horrific, bloody battle in which his friends and allies were being killed all around him.

After this incident, the US military introduced the 'sole survivor' policy whereby family members were forbidden to serve together in order to avoid such a tragedy ever occurring again. The scene where Miller tells Ryan his brothers are dead and Ryan asks 'Which ones?' only to be told that they have all been killed is taken almost word for word from the real life incident when the Sullivans were told of their sons' deaths."], ["What does FUBAR mean?", "It's an acronym: Fucked Up Beyond all Recognition, Reason or Repair. It was a common euphemism used by American troops during the war.

The rifle used by the American infantry during World War II was the Garand M1. It featured a new type of loading system that consisted of a metal \"clip\" that held eight rounds. The M1 was designed to be faster to load and fire during combat in \"semi-automatic\" fashion, compared with older \"bolt action\" rifles that had to be cycled for every shot, like the Karabiner 98k that we see the German soldiers using. With the M1, the rifle could be loaded and shot faster because the bolt cycled automatically. When Mellish or Caparzo had fired all eight shots, the clip would spring out instantly. Many GIs liked the rifle for its semi-automatic action, faster loading, and target accuracy but disliked this specific feature because it provided the enemy, by the noise and sight of the clip flying out, with the knowledge that an American soldier had emptied their rifle, meaning that the enemy could charge them. More info on the M1 can be read here."], ["Why were Miller's men so disrespectful to Upham even though he was a corporal and outranked them?", "Upham was the \"new guy\", someone who was not only unfamiliar with the other men but also combat-inexperienced -- this type of attitude was very common in every war the fought by the United States. Replacement soldiers, being inexperienced, were often killed in combat, therefore the experienced men would avoid forming friendships with them.\n\nAll the other men of Miller's squad had been through extensive combat prior to landing at Normandy & meeting Upham & considered him to be a weak addition to the unit despite his higher rank, which they plainly disregard. He does eventually earn more respect from the squad as we see right before the final battle when they joke around with him while preparing and listening to Edith Piaf on the phonograph."], ["Is it possible to shoot a sniper through his scope like Jackson did?", "Pvt. Jackson shooting the German sniper through the scope of his rifle is a reference to Vietnam War sniper Carlos Hathcock, who did the same thing to an enemy sniper. The enemy's rifle was recovered, and was photographed, and the bullet did go straight through the scope. However, because it was a one-in-a-million shot, it has been debated if this actually happened or if it's even possible. MythBusters tested the myth, and initially called the myth \"busted\", but because of the lack of authenticity, they tested the myth again under more precise conditions, recreating the incident using the same rifle and bullet Hathcock used and the same scope the soldier he killed used. They found that the bullets Hathcock claimed to have used couldn't completely clear the scope, but found that an armor-piercing bullet could completely penetrate the scope; the bullet went 2 inches into their dummy's head, which would easily kill the sniper. After the retest, they changed their conclusion from \"busted\" to \"plausible\" because, although their tests could easily have called it busted, they still didn't know the exact conditions of Hathcock's shot. Of course, we don't have any idea what kind of bullets Jackson used, so his amazing shot in the film is entirely plausible. Also it could be said that Jackson wasn't actually aiming for the sniper's scope, but simply for the sniper's head and happened to hit him in the eye through the scope. Mythbusters also determined that even if a bullet did not go through the scope, shooting at it could be effective as it would ruin the enemy's scope and potentially cause them serious head wounds from the scope being driven back into their eye as well as flying pieces of metal and glass."], ["Do officers really have their rank insignia stamped on their helmet?", "Yes. While ranks were usually omitted from helmets to avoid making officers targets (likely removed on the battlefield, but put on when on base) photos from D-Day show some officers wearing insignias. Also, there is an urban legend that uniforms are labelled incorrectly because this helps keep the actors from breaking the law of \"Impersonating military personnel.\" If their uniforms have a few deliberate inaccuracies on them, it isn't considered breaking the law. However, this isn't against the law for motion pictures in the U.S.A. It may also be a choice on part of the filmmakers to not have actors in proper military outfits, or it could be ignorance on part of the consultants or costume department."], ["Why does Miller's right hand shake and twitch frequently throughout the movie?", "It has been speculated by some viewers to be one or more of several things such as extreme anxiety, severe stress and worry, or PTSD. Given his breakdown after Wade dies, this is likely. Another possibility is that it is the early onset of Parkinson's Disease. Horvath asks Miller about his hand tremor in the church, to which Miller says he doesn't fully understand how or why his hand twitches. Later, at the rally camp, it twitches without him even realizing it as the members of the squad all observe it."], ["Why does Wade suddenly grab the dog tags the guys had already sifted through? What made him angry about it?", "Reiben, Jackson, Mellish, and even Capt. Miller took a rather callous and disrespectful approach to sorting through the tags, both to the dead soldiers and the other Airborne soldiers marching by. They were too casually tossing them aside and, like Wade suggested, treating them as one would treat \"poker chips\" in a card game. Additionally, their chatter while doing so was also callous and was overheard by at least some of the passing paratroopers. What's interesting is that Captain Miller, obviously a fair and moral officer, didn't realize this himself and even laughed at some of the jokes that Rieben, Mellish and Jackson were making. This may have been intentional by the film makers to show that even moral men like Miller can become desensitized and cold to the deaths of others during a war. The writers gave the responsibility to Wade of pointing this out to the others, at which point Miller seems to snap out of it and even shows some regret when looking at the Paratroopers passing by. Miller then puts an end to searching through the tags."], ["Why did Wade go on the attack of the MG42 nest instead of Upham? Wade didn't have a gun.", "Miller had a hard time finding interpreters. He had had one interpreter who spoke French and another who spoke German both of whom were killed on D-Day. He lucked out finding Upham who spoke both languages fluently. Also Upham had never been in combat, therefore wouldn't be much good in a frontal assault on a machine gun nest and would likely get himself or someone else killed. Wade went in on the attack as he was the medic, so he would be right there in the firefight in case someone got hit. Unfortunately Wade was the one who got hit. The German soldiers may not have realised he was a medic or he was hit accidentally."], ["Why didn't Wade carry a gun?", "During WWII the Geneva Conventions (the rules settled upon by both sides in the war) stipulated that if Medics were not to be fired upon during combat then they were not permitted to carry any sort of weapon."], ["Why does Capt Miller let Steamboat Willy go?", "Because of the Geneva Conventions which prohibit the summary execution of prisoners of war without a fair trial. According to the agreement, Willy can't be executed by Miller's squad simply because they believe he is the one who killed Wade and the other men from the 82nd Airborne lying dead in the field near the radar outpost. Of course, Spielberg & his writer, Robert Rodat, show a few scenes during the beach landings that clearly show American GIs callously killing German soldiers who are surrendering. Following the squad's attack on the radar post and Wade's horrific death, Miller's men are not only enraged enough to beat on Willy but also incredibly distraught over Wade, who was obviously well-liked by them all. Therefore, their mistreatment of Willy is already a violation, however, Miller realizes that executing Willy will not bring back Wade and would be a flagrant violation of the Geneva Conventions. So he lets Willy go, enraging his men further. Unfortunately, his act of mercy has the most serious of ramifications later on when Willy shoots Miller in the final battle -- like Reiben says, Willy is found by another German unit and put back into circulation."], ["Is Ramelle a real French town? What about the Merderet River?", "No, there isn't a town in France called Ramelle. It's a fictional name made up by the writers. The Merderet River, however, is real and winds through Normandy to the English Channel."], ["Is 'Steamboat Willie' the one who has the bayonet fight with Mellish?", "No! This is an extremely common misconception. The soldier who has the melee fight with Mellish in the upstairs part of the restaurant is not Steamboat Willie, although they do look similar. What actually happened is that the Bayonet Soldier was another soldier entirely who gets in a fight with Mellish and wins. When leaving the room, Bayonet Soldier sees Upham, frozen with fear and sobbing. Upham even takes his hand off his rifle to show he was of no threat. The Bayonet Soldier decides to spare Upham as he posed no threat and it wasn't necessary to kill him. Later on we see Steamboat Willie in the same battle where he shoots Miller. This was witnessed by Upham, so Upham finally gained the will to pull the trigger on Willie while he was unarmed and surrendered. Mirroring the earlier scene in which he defended a captured Willie against execution by Miller's squad."], ["What does the German soldier say when killing Mellish with the bayonet?", "As the German soldier stabs Mellish to death, he says: \"Gib' auf, du hast keine Chance! Lass' es uns beenden! Es ist einfacher f\u00fcr dich, viel einfacher. Du wirst sehen, es ist gleich vorbei.\" Translation: \"Give up, you don't stand a chance! Let's end this here! It will be easier for you, much easier. You'll see it will be over quickly.\""], ["Why didn't the German soldier who killed Mellish kill Upham?", "The soldier saw that Upham was shocked and sobbing, and Upham even took his hand off his rifle to show that he wasn't intending to attack the soldier. So the German decided he was not going to hurt Upham, and even glances back to make sure he wouldn't do anything. This also shows that the Germans weren't monsters but just soldiers. Upham posed no threat to the German soldier and so he didn't feel it necessary to kill him. It is also likely that the solder realized that Upham could have killed him if he had been courageous enough to intervene in the fight in which Mellish died and since he was a coward he was ashamed to kill him."], ["Why did Horvath continue to fire bazooka rounds at the Tiger tank when he knew they wouldn't stop it?", "Sgt Horvath was probably trying to incapacitate, not destroy, the turret on the Tiger tank. Allied forces familiar with the Panzer VI \"Tiger\", a 60-ton Main Battle Tank during the war knew that the armor is very tough and, even with support fire from a friendly tank, the odds of destroying a Tiger tank with a bazooka like Horvath's are pretty small. From the infantry perspective, techniques that were developed and employed in order to combat heavy Tiger tanks focused mainly on disabling the tank rather than destroying it. Anti-tank weapons of the era, such as the bazooka, were ineffective against most areas of the Tiger's armor, so specific weak points in the design were the focus. Hitting the Tiger in the tracks, suspension, engine compartment, observation slits, and in the joint between the main body and turret were some of the common weak points. Tiger tanks could only be destroyed head-on or from the sides by land mines, or direct hits by heavy artillery shells, or bombs dropped from aircraft. In the film, the first Tiger is disabled by taking out the tracks with \"sticky bombs\" followed by grenades thrown in the turret hatch. When Horvath fires at the second Tiger, both shots are clearly placed on the joint between the body and the turret, the idea most likely being to hinder or incapacitate the turret's ability to swivel left or right. As the war went on, the Allies developed better strategies for disabling Tigers. One example involved either British Cromwell and/or US Sherman tanks trying to \"flank\" a Tiger by working in squadrons or columns. One or more tanks would act as a diversion to keep the Tiger's crew focused in front of it while another tank would maneuver behind the Tiger and hit it in the rear section where its armor was the weakest."], ["Why does the German soldier who shoots Miller seem familiar?", "Because this man is the same prisoner of war that was released earlier in the film by Captain Miller himself. Known as \"Steamboat Willie,\" this German soldier stumbles away from the main characters while many of the men complain that Miller just let the enemy simply walk away. He rejoins the ranks of the German army and (if by mere coincidence or planning?) encounters Miller's men during this particular battle. Whether Steamboat Willie knows he is shooting Miller is debatable, but it is a sad and ironic twist of fate that Miller is shot by the man towards whom he showed so much mercy."], ["Why does Upham finally kill 'Steamboat Willie'?", "Although he pleaded for Willie's life earlier in the movie, Upham saw Willie back on the front with his comrades, and they were all shooting to kill. Some viewers say that Upham kills Willie because he witnesses Willie killing Miller. That is unlikely, however, given Upham's position in relation to the German's fire. All the rifleman were shooting simultaneously. Without sharing their line of sight, it would be almost impossible to deduce whose bullet targeted who. After Miller is shot, the camera does pan back to Upham's bewildered face, implying that he witnessed Miller's death. Consequently, the most likely reason Upham executes Willie is because seeing Willie again with his fellow riflemen revealed Willie's lack of honor, contrary to the qualities that Upham claimed when he was trying to spare Willie's execution, and for the first time, Upham is able to fire on the enemy,"], ["Why does Reiben tap the magazine for his BAR against his helmet before loading the rifle?", "He's lining up the primer ends of the rounds in the magazine. When he raps them on his helmet, they are forced flush against the interior of that wall of the magazine. When they're all lined up, there's less of a chance that they'll jam in the breech of the rifle, forcing the operator to stop shooting and clear the jammed round from the breech, costing valuable seconds or minutes during combat."], ["When the soldiers drop the grenades in the tank, why don't you see an explosion or anything of the sort?", "If you listen closely you can hear fragments of the grenades hitting the interior walls of the tank, the sound effect used is very similar to the sound effect of certain gunshots used in the film, so it is easily missed. You wouldn't naturally see smoke anyway due to them closing the hatch, which is roughly 2 inches of thick metal, as is the exterior of the tank turret itself. Typically, grenades used in combat are fragmentation grenades. A charge is ignited inside the grenade causing it to explode and project shrapnel. The familiar sight of a grenade causing a firey explosion is most often for dramatic or FX purposes."], ["How does the movie end?", "As the P-51 Mustang fighters zoom in to bomb the German tanks, Reiben and Ryan rush to Miller's side. Reiben calls for a medic while Ryan sits with Miller. Miller whispers in his ear 'Earn this...earn it.' As more American troops swarm the bridge, General Marshall is heard reading a letter to Ryan's mother in which he informs her that James is on his way home. He concludes the letter by quoting a passage written by ex-President Abraham Lincoln: 'I pray that our Heavenly Father may assuage the anguish of your bereavement and leave you only with the cherished memory of the loved and lost and the solemn pride that must be yours to have laid so costly a sacrifice upon the altar of freedom.' The scene then cuts to the cemetery as shown in at the beginning of the movie, and the audience learns that the elderly man is James Ryan and that he is visiting the gravesite of Captain Miller. With tears in his eyes, he tells Miller that he hopes he's earned what Miller and others did for him, and his wife assures him that he's a good man. In the final scene, Ryan salutes Miller's grave, and the screen is filled with the American flag gently flapping in the breeze."], ["Out of the squadron, who actually dies?", "Caparzo is shot through the lung by a German sniper and dies. Wade is fatally wounded when the team tries to take out a German machine gun post (it is also implied that he deliberately wanted enough morphine to kill himself so he won't have to endure the pain). Jackson is killed during the final battle when a tank fires onto the bell tower, destroying the top where he was stationed. Mellish is killed in a bayonet fight. Horvath is killed after being hit by what appears to be shrapnel that hits him in the back and exits through the front of his chest, just above the heart. Miller is shot in the chest by Steamboat Willie and dies soon after. Reiben and Upham are the only two to survive."], ["Are the Germans portrayed unfairly?", "There are two scenes in which the American characters come into close contact with German soldiers. In both of those scenes, the Germans are portrayed simply as soldiers fighting for their country and their families. While it is understandable that those of German heritage, who likely had a relative fight for their country during World War II, might be displeased with films in which the Germans are portrayed as the antagonists, they should also understand that _Saving Private Ryan_ (qv) is filmed to look like a documentary from the Allied perspective. For the most part, the German soldiers are shown as \"the enemy in the distance\", as it would appear if a documentary is being shot from within the ranks of the Allies. See also: _Das Boot (1981)_ (qv), which shows the war from the German perspective and does not portray the Allied soldiers as evil monsters, simply as \"the enemy in the distance.\" One should remember that the Germans were fighting a war of aggression that their leaders started, and they were in fact occupying a foreign country. The argument could be made that the common, non-Waffen SS German soldiers were only following orders and were not involved in the politics, and though that's true, it's also true that many of them had been indocrinated into believing that what they were being ordered to do was right. The truth is that some ordinary German soldiers committed atrocities (predominantly mutilation and murder) against captured Allied soldiers in Normandy, and many Allied soldiers retaliated in kind. It's difficult to portray soldiers of an aggressor, occupying army unfairly."], ["Is this a historically accurate film?", "No, while the invasion of Omaha Beach did happen, it wasn't taken in 25 minutes as the film depicts. This movie is fiction based on true events, and is not intended to be an educational documentary. It seems that 'Tom Hanks' (qv) character claiming 'first wave ineffective' would be an attempt to suggest that his landing wave was the second with the first being almost completely annihilated, which would keep with reality though there is no apparent carnage on the beach as the second wave approaches. However, when the soldiers are jumping into the water, we see the ocean floor is completely covered with crates, bodies and helmets. We only see a few men jump into the water, which may imply that this was from the first wave. Also Miller says \"All the armour is floundering in the channel!\" which suggests that transports carrying tanks had been sunk prior to their arrival. Other dramatic license is the fictional town portrayed at the end of the movie. The battle that took place has been criticized for it's lack of realism in planning and tactics. However it could be argued that the director wanted to keep the details of the battle as simple as possible for the sake of the viewer. SS units were not in Normandy at the time of the landings. They had been moved further eastward towards the Pas de Calais where Hitler thought the landings would take place."]], "0091251": null, "0060827": null, "0477348": [["A Note Regarding Spoilers", "The following FAQ entries may contain spoilers.

In the book, Chigurh tells Carson Wells ('Woody Harrelson' (qv)) that he had allowed himself to get arrested to see if he could escape. Chigurh had murdered a man in a bar fight the previous night; the man had insulted him. According to Chigurh's description, he had either snapped the man's neck or strangled him."], ["In what time period does the film take place?", "The story takes place in June 1980.

The phone bill Chigurh picks up is dated 1980, and 1980 is the date of death on one of the graves."], ["What is that tank that Chigurh uses to punch out locks?", "Chigurh uses a captive bolt pistol, which is also known as a cattle gun. The tank itself is pressurized air. Releasing the air valve powers the bolt when triggered and it retracts automatically. Chigurh probably uses it to avoid leaving any evidence with his victims like powder burns or a bullet. Sheriff Bell makes a reference to this device in his first conversation with Carla Jean Moss ('Kelly Macdonald' (qv)), but does not appear to consciously connect the dots."], ["Why does Llewelyn pick up his spent rifle cartridge?", "The most likely explanation is that he loads his own ammunition and so he re-uses spent cartridges."], ["Why did Chigurh kill the two Managerials at the scene of the drug deal gone bad?", "There are a variety of reasons for which Chigurh could have killed The Managerials. Initially it might have appeared as if Chigurh killed them in order to double-cross his employer. It is likely that this was what The Man Who Hired Wells ('Stephen Root' (qv)) thought was happening, causing him to declare that Chigurh had gone rogue and to hire Wells to clean up. Events later on in the movie all but discount this as a possibility, especially at such an early stage. Chigurh apparently takes his job very seriously and it may be that he felt they did not share that same level of professionalism. Later on we discover that Chigurh doesn't like to work with others at all when he says to The Accountant, \"You pick the one right tool.\" This makes it seem that this was the main reason he killed the Managerials. He had been hired to do a job and did not expect anybody else to be given the same job. Another motive of Chigurh may have been his desire to swap out his car for their truck. The \"Mind ridin' bitch?\" comment and their general attitude also did not improve their chances of staying on Chigurh's good side but since Chigurh is a professional killer, it probably didn't faze him very much to begin with and he was planning to kill them regardless of what they said to him."], ["Who were the Mexicans in the first motel room, and why does Chigurh kill them?", "The three Mexicans at the Del Rio motel may have been hired by The Man Who Hires Wells (as well as Chigurh). Another possibility is that they are from the drug side of the deal-gone-bad. The Man Who Hires Wells mentions that the other side is \"out their product\", implying that the drugs were also reported as taken by a third party (whether they actually were or not is unknown, though the truck bed is empty when Bell arrives at the deal scene). Because of this it is possible that the three Mexicans are from the drug side of the deal and The Man Who Hired Wells gave them a transponder to assuage their employer, the drug side, who was apparently unhappy with the way the deal went down. They used this transponder to find Llewelyn Moss' ('Josh Brolin' (qv)) motel room and incorrectly assumed that the satchel was somewhere inside the room, when in fact it was a few yards away in the ventilation duct between rooms. It is not known for certain which party the Mexicans represent, only that they were given a transponder at some point by The Man Who Hired Wells. This is explained in the conversation between Chigurh and the Accountant ('Trent Moore' (qv)). The Accountant does not explain the Mexicans' affiliation, only that The Man Who Hired Wells felt that the money would be found faster with more people looking for it. This makes it likely that he hired them to find the money, but that is not necessarily the case. The Mexicans incorrectly assumed the money was in the room. When Chigurh bursts into the room after punching out the lock (finding the room with his own transponder) the Mexicans, probably after searching the room and not finding the satchel, were waiting to ambush Moss when he entered the room. Unfortunately for them, it was not Moss who entered, it was Chigurh who murders all of them assuming they had already found the satchel. He searches the room and checks the one place they did not, the air duct. He finds the marks the the satchel made when Moss pushed it through, and eventually took it out the other end and escaped. Later on, after the final unseen shootout at the end of the film, this is how Chigurh knows the satchel would be in the airduct and takes it after the police finally leave the scene of the crime."], ["What is the shotgun Anton Chigurh uses?", "A sound-suppressed Remington 11-87 Semi-Auto shotgun with a sawed-off barrel. The suppressor is probably custom-made, perhaps by Chigurh himself, who likely has military training & may have learned how to make one. The shotgun itself is anachronistic since it was released in 1987 & the film clearly takes place in 1980. More information on the guns used in the film can be found here: here."], ["Can a shotgun really be silenced with a silencer like Chigurh has done?", "Though shotgun silencers and silenced shotguns do exist, they are not nearly as effective at reducing the muzzle report as pistol or rifle silencers. The silencer Chigurh has attached to his shotgun is intended only for cinematic effect and would actually do very little to reduce the muzzle report of the shotgun he uses. Generally the noise of gunshots (silenced or otherwise) are added to a film's audio after filming, as microphones do not accurately record the sound very well."], ["What role did Carson Wells play in this whole drama, and was he really as brainy as he let on?", "Carson Wells was hired by the man who also apparently hired Chigurh to kill Llewlynn Moss and retrieve the money, as Chigurh had been hired to do originally. The Man Who Hired Wells declares that Chigurh has gone rogue, which means he either thought Chigurh had or was in the process of double crossing him or that he simply did not approve of Chigurh's methods. He hires Wells to clean up the situation. Wells' exact profession is unknown. He claims he is merely a \"day trader,\" implying that he may moonlight as a hitman/bounty hunter/mercenary or just do it in his free time, whereas it seems to be Chigurh's full time profession. However, this may have just been self-deprecation in order to humble himself to Chigurh in the hopes that he might be spared. We cannot know his actual profession for sure, but it is safe to assume that he was contracted in a way similar to Chigurh and so both probably have the same occupation. Late in the film, he is referred to as a retired colonel. The movie does indicate that Wells is highly intelligent, observant and alert, however, this is not enough to save him from Chigurh. Wells also seems to be cocky and overconfident, and Chigurh is able to get the drop on him."], ["What does Wells mean when he remarks to The Man Who Hired Wells: \"I counted the floors of this building from the street. There's one missing?\"", "Two possibilities exist:\n\n1) It was just Wells giving another \"attempt at humor\" because most buildings that have enough floors that go in to the double-digits will have the floor number 13 removed. Next time you go into a high-rise check the elevator and see if there's a \"13\" button. Many modern buildings have a 13th floor, but older buildings were built with superstition in mind. So when Wells said there was one missing, he was referring to the 13th floor. Which is why The Man Who Hires Wells looks at him rather irritated and just says \"We'll look in to it.\" returning the sarcasm.\n\n2) Wells is intelligent, aware, and intuitive. He displays this behavior through-out the film (finding Llewlyn in merely 3 hours and knowing his familial circumstance, etc.). It would be fair to assume that, since he was to be hired to track down Chigurh and the money, he would want to know his employer and their business. While doing so, he noticed a discrepancy between the building's exterior having MORE floors than what the the elevator button panel showed (less floors, one being 13 as in answer one and an additional separate missing floor). If this is true, then a floor is in fact missing. What occurs on that floor is open to interpretation (i.e drug trafficking). This could also explain how the business came to deal with losing money and it being the hands of drug traffickers."], ["Why did Chigurh kill The Man Who Hired Wells?", "Chigurh killed The Man Who Hired Wells because he had tasked people other than Chigurh with finding the money. Chigurh saw these people as an unnecessary inconvenience and so he eliminated them as they were encountered, starting with the managerials out in the desert at night. The last straw for Chigurh is when he finds that Wells has been hired to kill him. Interestingly, after killing The Man Who Hired Wells, Chigurh only mentions that a transponder was given to the Mexicans from Moss' first motel room and nothing about the fact that somebody had been hired to kill him. When the accountant explains why the Mexicans also received a transponder, Chigurh says, \"That's foolish. You pick the one right tool,\" implying that The Man Who Hired Wells had brought this on himself by tasking others with finding the money, instead of relying on Chigurh alone. Despite his reasons given, it is likely that the main reason that Chigurh decided to kill The Man Who Hired Wells had to do with the fact that he hired Wells . Chigurh, while psychotic, has principles. Out of all the possible reasons as to why Chigurh killed the two managerials in the desert, if it was simply because he found them to be an inconvenience and not because he was double crossing his employer, The Man Who Hires Wells may not have been killed by Chigurh. That is to say that if the Man Who Hired Wells didn't take the killing of two of his men as a double cross and, in turn, did not give the Mexicans a receiver or hire Wells, and instead let Chigurh finish his job, it is possible Chigurh would have completed his task and given back the money to his respective employer. Unfortunately, The Man Who Hires Wells thought Chigurh had gone rogue and sealed his fate after hiring Wells and helping the Mexicans."], ["Did Chigurh kill The Accountant that was in the office of The Man Who Hired Wells?", "It is left ambiguous as to whether or not Chigurh killed The Accountant. When the accountant asks if Chigurh is going to shoot him, Chigurh replies by saying, \"That depends. Do you see me?\" This implies that if The Accountant plays blind, Chigurh will not kill him. The script has the accountant answering Chigurh's question with a, \"No,\" (the scene then changed) which would imply that he lives. The question could have also been rhetorical, being that he obviously *does* see him, meaning yes, he will kill him."], ["What happens at the El Paso motel?", "Llewelyn Moss goes to the motel and waits to be reunited with Carla Jean and Agnes (her mother). While waiting, the poolside woman ('Ana Reeder' (qv)) flirts with him and offers him beers. What happens next can be seen as ambiguous, the first option is that the Mexicans knew where he was headed because Agnes had told them at the bus station. During the ensuing shootout, the poolside woman was killed and her body was found in the pool. Moss was able to shoot one of the Mexicans before he was shot in the chest and died inside his motel room. The remaining Mexicans ran off as Sheriff Bell pulled into the parking lot. The second option is that Bell actually comes across a shoot out between the Mexicans and Chigurh who has already killed Moss and the poolside woman. The evidence for this is circumstancial at best, The Mexicans are using machine guns which we hear, one of the Mexicans has been shot (by either Llewelyn or Chigurh) but we don't hear this. The machine gun casings are a considerable distance from the shot Mexican, why would the Mexicans be shooting towards their own man? There are no bullet holes observed in Llewelyns room or in the wall surrounding the door."], ["Where was Chigurh when Bell went back to the El Paso motel room?", "It is open to interpretation and speculation regarding the exact nature of the closest thing to an encounter between Chigurh and Bell in the movie. There are at least four possibilities.\n\n1) Chigurh is indeed behind the door when we (and Bell) see what looks like his reflection through the lock tube. Bell draws his weapon and some time passes as he prepares himself to enter under the assumption that Chigurh is still inside. This may have given Chigurh some time to hide somewhere in the motel room. When Bell does enter, Chigurh is no longer behind the door (Bell doesn't even check there, although he does push the door open enough that if Chigurh were there he would probably know it). Bell checks the bathroom and finds the rear window locked. He then returns to the main room and sits down on the bed. He soon sees that the vent has been removed, implying that the money is gone and that Chigurh has it. During the time that Bell was in the bathroom it is possible that Chigurh left the room and escaped. Since Chigurh has the money he has no reason to go out of his way to kill Bell, and it is possible that he simply did the practical thing and escaped to avoid any further complications.\n\n2) The second and third possibilities are similar but still distinct. They would be (2) that Chigurh is either in an adjacent room (the one to the left as we face the rooms as Bell walks towards them, for example) when we see him hiding behind the door (in what would have to be a mirrored shot due to the arrangement of the rooms) or\n\n3) We see him hiding behind the door earlier in time by several minutes, being cautious about exiting the room. The first would make sense considering Moss' earlier method of hiding the money and making it accessible from another room. Other evidence to suggest this is the fact that both the room Moss was killed in (room 114) and the adjacent room (room 112) are behind police tape, implying both were part of the crime scene. It is difficult to determine by the film whether the lock was punched out in the adjacent room, however. The second would fit with the usual situation of Bell arriving moments too late to find Chigurh, which is one of the reasons he says that he might call him a \"ghost.\" The fourth possibility is that Chigurh is already long gone and the reflection in the lock tube and the image of Chigurh waiting behind the door are all in Bell's imagination as expressions of his fear, the fear that he confronts (or attempts to confront) by entering the room anyway. There is strong evidence against any theory that Chigurh was not there when Sheriff Bell arrived. That evidence is the crime scene tape, the shadow of which can be seen on the door just as Sheriff Bell enters the room, projected by the headlights of Bell's car. This crime scene tape shadow is also projected on the wall of the hotel room after Bell opens the door. After Bell leaves the bathroom, he sits on the bed and we can see that the shadow of the crime scene tape is no longer on the wall, implying that it has been broken by someone escaping the hotel room, or the adjacent hotel room. However, it should be noted that the two pieces of crime scene tape are actually still intact when Bell sits on the bed, in other camera angles. While the tape shadow no longer appears on the large wall nearest the bathroom, the tape shadow still appears intact on the wall with the TV, when the camera is on Bell's face as he notices the ventilation grate has been removed. Just before the camera cuts away from Bell's face and to the ventilation grate, the two pieces of crime scene tape can briefly be seen flapping in the wind, showing they are still intact. Therefore, it is difficult to make any strong conclusions regarding a theory of someone (Chigurh) leaving and breaking the tape. It may be nothing more than an oversight in the scene's continuity.\n\nBecause we know that Chigurh was indeed there at some point, we could consider a combination of either possibility 2 or 3 combined with 4 as being what actually happened or what we are being shown. This would mean that we aren't seeing something that is purely Bell's imagination (although what we see may have been influenced by it), but instead what actually happened \"5 minutes ago\" or \"in the next room over\" might be shown to illustrate what Bell is feeling: that Chigurh is somewhere around and that he will be in danger upon entering the room. In other words, there was some trick editing where we are being shown a different time or a different place interlaced with the current time and/or location in such a way that makes it appear to be happening concurrently to the scenes with Bell. Other movies use this technique to fool the audience into thinking two things are happening in the movie at the same time in the same place, when in reality one has already happened or happened in a different place, or both.\n\nIn the end, it matters little where Chigurh was (which is one of the reasons it was left ambiguous). What is important is that we are shown that Bell thinks he is still in there and enters the room anyway, confronting his fear and possibly putting his soul at hazard. Once again he is too late and Chigurh is gone with the money, but he didn't know that before he entered the room. This matches closely the description of the scene from the book. The scene has been changed but the end result is basically the same. In the book it is clearly stated to the reader that Chigurh is still at the motel when Bell arrives. Chigurh is in the parking lot, notices a car coming and hides in his car as he watches Bell park and go inside the motel room. After Bell has finished searching the motel room he prepares to exit the room, and we \"hear\" what he is thinking. Just as he is about to exit the room he indicates that he is aware that Chigurh could be in one of the many cars in the parking lot, and that he would be helpless if Chigurh were to open fire on him from that vantage point. He exits the room anyway, gets in his car and drives down the road where he stops and watches the parking lot. He has called for backup and he waits until backup arrives, and when they do, a search of the parking lot returns nothing. The reader doesn't know how Chigurh escapes."], ["What happened to Agnes and Carla Jean?", "Agnes ('Beth Grant' (qv)) died of her cancer. It is implied that Chigurh killed Carla Jean. After she refuses to call the coin toss, Chigurh is seen leaving her house and checking his boots, presumably to make sure he doesn't have any blood on them. In an earlier scene, Chigurh, after shooting Carson Wells, sees the blood coming down the floor and puts his feet on the bed, to avoid getting blood on his boots. (In the book, she does eventually call the coin toss and when it is incorrect, he shoots her.) When he kills all the Mexicans in the hotel room, he does so wearing white socks, which he the takes off and leaves behind. Also, when the Mexicans drive away following the death of Llewelyn, we hear a sound very similar to the sound we hear when Chigurh exits Carla Jean's house: the sound of the bikes the two boys are riding. The Coens could have used this sound as a director's trick to make us believe she met the same fate as Llewelyn."], ["Why doesn't Carson Wells retrieve the case of money from the bushes when he spots it from looking over the fence at the Mexican border?", "One explanation is that he intended to retrieve it under the cover of darkness and after changing into clothes that would offer some level of camouflage compared to his garish western attire. Unfortunately he is not able to follow through with this due to his encounter with Anton Chigurh on the way to his hotel room. Also, Carson may have believed that the case was difficult for anyone else to see if they weren't specifically looking for it like he was. Also, he may not have been certain that he saw the briefcase. He could have either been bluffing Chigurh perhaps hoping for an opportunity to get the upper hand on the way to get the money or hoping the briefcase was in fact there."], ["What happened to Chigurh?", "After meeting with Carla Jean, Chigurh got in a serious car accident, with a compound fracture of his forearm. A couple of teenagers ('Josh Blaylock' (qv) and 'Caleb Landry Jones' (qv)) on bikes approach him, asking if he's ok (he clearly isn't, having several cuts on him and an injured eye). He pays one of the kids for his shirt so he can make a sling for his arm, gets to his feet and flees the scene of the accident. Whether he died or not is up for the viewer's interpretation. With an injury like that, he would likely have died without medical attention. That being said, he is seen to tend to his own gunshot wound earlier in the film, but the idea of him setting his own broken bone is unlikely (you need someone else to apply lateral force to get the bones to re-align). The book also leaves this to interpretation. It may be possible he has access to a \"back alley\" doctor or at least knows where to find one. Chigurh believes in the random nature of fate, and that is what happens to him at the end. The killing of Carla Jean is unnecessary if he has the money. It only keeps the promise he made to the now-dead Moss. So, the car running into him is \"instant karma' for his lack of \"principle\"."], ["What happened to the money?", "Although it is left open for interpretation, it is implied that Anton Chigurh wound up with the money. After the police activity died down, Chigurh sneaked into Moss' room and unscrewed the vent to retrieve the satchel of money. He knew this is where the money would be because he saw the track marks inside the vent of the Del Rio motel room, and knew that Moss kept it in the vent. When Sheriff Bell arrives at the El Paso motel, he sees that the vent was unscrewed by a coin, which Chigurh used in the previous motel. However, a shot of the vent in the El Paso motel shows that the vent may be too small to have accommodated the case containing the money. But, after Chigurh is involved in the car accident at the end, he offers the bicycle boys a hundred dollar bill, which implies that he did wind up with the money. In the book, Chigurh found the money and returned it to a third party. Like Wells said, he did have his principles!"], ["What's the significance of Sheriff Bell's two dreams at the end?", "The two dreams can be seen as expressions of what Bell is struggling with throughout the course of the story and the change of perspective that allows him to come to terms with his struggle. In the first dream he says his father entrusted him with some money, but he (Bell) lost it. This can be seen as Bell feeling as if he was entrusted with a responsibility and has failed to uphold it. His failure to keep and protect something valuable like the money is analogous to his failure as a law enforcement officer to protect people like Moss and Carla Jean, other civilians, and to make a significant impact on crime in general. This dream explains what is troubling him and that he feels or is afraid that he may be a failure. Because his father is mentioned explicitly it is likely that he may feel he has failed his father, who was also a law-man, on a personal level.\n\nThe second dream is a reconciliation of the problem from the first. In the second dream, he says he and his father were riding through the mountains in the old times. His father rode up ahead of him and went on into the cold and dark with some fire. Bell said that he knew when he got to where his father was going, his father would be there waiting for him. This indicates that Bell realizes that his father is waiting for him nonetheless, whether he is a failure or not. The dark and cold would represent the unknowable near future and eventual certain death, and the fire represents comfort, protection and hope. His father carries it onward, and Bell knows he will be waiting with it for him when he joins him in the future. The dream seems to be an encouragement to continue in his dangerous profession, rather than retire. The second dream also indicates that Bell has come to a realization, at least on some level, of the concept that Ellis ('Barry Corbin' (qv)) spoke of in their earlier conversation. Ellis says, \"Whatcha got ain't nothin new. This country's hard on people, you can't stop what's coming, it ain't all waiting on you. That's vanity.\", meaning that Bell can not expect himself to succeed at the standard he has held himself to, and so it is unreasonable to do so. Bell felt compelled to continue on past a reasonable age and into unmanageable situations in order to uphold the responsibility he felt had been passed down to him. When he realizes he can't do this he feels overmatched and quits by retiring. He had tasked himself with the impossible (in an attempt to live up to his father, or previous law-men, etc.) and blamed himself for failing to succeed. Bell may not realize it consciously yet, but the dreams show that on some level after his talk with Ellis he realized that the world had always been this way and always would be (dark and cold) but that there are sources of refuge and comfort waiting for him.\n\nAnd then he wakes up."], ["What is the song in the red-band trailer?", "\"Young Men Dead\" by The Black Angels."]], "0031381": [["A Note Regarding Spoilers", "The following FAQ entries may contain spoilers.

By the 1950s, Tara was quite dilapidated from exposure to the weather and from the fact that like most sets it was only a facade, with no rear enclosure. See here. It was used as the decaying family mansion on the television series _Yancy Derringer_ (qv) in 1958-1959. In 1959 the set was sold, dismantled, and shipped to Atlanta, Georgia, where it was going to be the centerpiece of a theme park. In 1980 the late Betty Talmadge (wife of Georgia Senator Herman Talmadge) bought Tara and stored it in her barn south of Atlanta, Ga. In 2014, Peter Bonner, creator of the only GWTW Tour (his book, Lost In Yesterday is filled with the true stories and is available at peterbonner.com) began the Saving Tara Project (see savingtara.com) which has cleaned up the existing pieces and begun giving tours of the site. The doors, windows and side porches still exist and are being displayed in the barn for now. The front doorway of Tara was restored by the owners (Talmadge) and is on temporary display at Atlanta's Margaret Mitchell House & Museum, which also has the large oil painting of Scarlett seen in the movie.

Some supporting characters dropped from the novel are Will Benteen, a poor Confederate veteran who loves Carreen but marries Suellen; the colorful Mrs Tarleton, mother of Brent and Stuart; Ashley's other sister Honey Wilkes, whose character is combined with India Wilkes in the movie; Ellen O'Hara's sisters Pauline and Eulalie; Melanie and Charles' Uncle Henry Hamilton; Mrs Elsing and Mrs Whiting, two of the pillars of Atlanta society; and the servant Dilcey, former head woman at Twelve Oaks and the wife of Pork. In the book, they reverse some of the order of events with Melanie and Scarlett. After Scarlett and Charles Hamilton were engaged, Scarlett went about planning her wedding specifically so it would be the day before Melanie's. (A very rude thing to do considering Melanie and Ashley were engaged first.) In the movie Melanie mentions her wedding was the day before.

Realising the injustice, Henry made the long journey south to Louisiana and successfully brokered a deal for Solomon's release.

In the hands of a ghost writer by the name of David Wilson, Northup started to provide input for his book. It was published around the middle of July, 1853, after just three and a half months of research, writing, and interviews by the white ghost writer Wilson, who was himself a prominent New York lawyer and author of two books about local history.

The two men were arrested but never convicted. Disagreements over where the case should be tried, New York or the District of Columbia, led to the decision over jurisdiction to be sent to the New York Supreme Court and then to the New York Court of Appeals. This was after three of the four counts against the two men had already been dropped since it was determined that these counts originated in Washington, D.C., not the state of New York. During this time, the men in custody applied for release. Joseph Russell's bail was nominal and Alexander Merrill's bail was set at $800. The New York Court of Appeals reversed the decision of the lower courts, citing that the indictment legally could not be split, with one count being valid while the other three were ruled invalid due to issues over jurisdiction. In May of 1857, the case was discharged and the two men were never brought to trial."], ["When and how did Solomon Northup die?", "The last known details about Solomon Northup's life are mostly speculative and no one is certain of his exact fate.

Some believe that this could have led to him being murdered, while others have conjectured that it's possible he was kidnapped again, or that his two former kidnappers who had been on trial went looking for Northup and killed him.

Their age difference is approximately ten years, so Indy would have been in his mid-20s and she around 15 or 16 when they first met and fell in love.

It was actually Reichsf\u00fchrer-SS, Heinrich Himmler (leader of the Schutzstaffel/SS), an alleged Thule Society member and who had a fond interest in the occult. Himmler also promoted and founded the Ahnenerbe, a research department focused on cultural and anthropological history of the Aryan Race, as well as delving into Aryan Mysticism and occult artifacts. Hitler, although fond of Mysticism, would ridicule and poke fun of Himmler's staunch obsession of the subject according to multiple eyewitnesses at the time."], ["Could the map room procedure have actually shown where the Ark was located?", "No. There were far too many variables in play for the procedure to actually work. First of all, the staff and crystal medallion would have had to been at the correct height. Ancient peoples did not have precise measuring equipment, which is why a foot is the length of a foot and a cubit the length of a forearm. The length of Indy's staff would therefore not be the exact length needed. Secondly, the relationship between the sun and the horizon changes from day to day. Every day the sun rises further north or south from the previous day depending on the time of the year. If by chance he did have the staff at the correct height he would still have to hope it was the right time of the year. But there is one further problem: in the thousands of years since the map room was created the Earth has shifted on its axis (it's one of the reasons the Earth periodically has Ice Ages). Sailing ships in the past could often navigate at night because the Earth's axis pointed toward the North Star. At the time the map room was built the Earth's axis did NOT point at the North Star. Thus, there is no reason to think it would have worked. It's purely movie magic and myth and does make for one of the more memorable and exciting moments in the movie."], ["Where does Belloq get his \"copy\" of the Staff of Ra headpiece?", "Toht picked up the original during the fight in Marion's bar.

And by some trick of ancient artistry, this one building responds to the sunlight like none of the others. The golden light permeates it: it seems to glow.

The location of the Ark he'd gotten from the previous scene showed that it was still pretty close to the main excavation. They could dig for it there, fairly well hidden from the Nazis and Belloq, but it was still close enough that they could be discovered. If Marion disappeared suddenly, Belloq and the Nazi officers would do just what Indy said; they'd comb the place until she was found.

Both are hardy drinkers, as we see with Marion winning the shot contest in her bar early in the movie against a man much larger than herself. Belloq was also a hardy drinker, having grown up drinking the wine he provided, which was, in his cheerful words, \"my family label.\" Wine is much less potent than the whiskey Marion was drinking earlier, and she was able to stay sober. Assuming that Belloq was going to be inebriated faster than she was, she could escape easier. However, her assumption was wrong, and Belloq was just as sober as she was -- and Toht arrived just at the moment she tried to walk out."], ["Why didn't anyone find the Well of Souls through the loose stone?", "The entire Nazi research team lead by Belloq were searching for the Ark. They wouldn't have bothered excavating just anywhere in the ancient city. This would have been extremely expensive and time-consuming (it is mentioned that Hitler's patience for the project was wearing thin as it was). They were digging specifically in the location where they believed the Ark to be, which was incorrect. Indy and Sallah were digging in the correct place, which was near the outskirts of the ancient city.

Early submarines generally traveled the oceans on the surface of the water under diesel power, which requires access to the air for inlets to the engines. They could only travel short distances under water, as this required electric propulsion and the battery power of the submarine did not last very long. German U-boats would only submerge when they'd attack surface ships. However, there would generally be four or five crewman on the conning tower as lookouts. U-boats generally would submerge to a depth of roughly 12 meters, deep enough to observe the surface through the periscope. In the novelization, Indy lashed himself to the periscope with his bullwhip and rode/dozed through 20 frigid hours in oceanic water. In the movie, we never see the sub fully submerge, so are left with the conclusion that Indy rode on the top, a more believable scenario than riding it underwater without freezing or drowning."], ["How does the movie end?", "Although tethered to a pole, Indy and Marion are allowed to watch as Belloq opens the Ark, cameras rolling to record the momentous event. In it, they find only sand. Suddenly, lights begin flashing and bulbs exploding. Fog begins pouring out of the Ark and jets of light shoot upwards. Indy warns Marion to shut her eyes and not look at it...no matter what. The rays of light turn into ethereal beings then into skeletons. Beams of fire course through the bodies of the soldiers, consuming everyone but Indy and Marion. The fire courses upward into the skies, taking the Ark's lid with it and then depositing it back upon the Ark.

Weeks later, Indy and colleague Dr Marcus Brody ('Denholm Elliott' (qv)) are in Washington being thanked (and paid) by the Army officers. Brody asks where the Ark is now, but the only answer he's given is that it's being researched by 'top men'.

In the final scene, a workman is shown locking a box marked 'Top Secret...Army Intel...Do not open' and storing it in a warehouse stocked with thousands of other such boxes."], ["How did Indy know not to look into the Ark when it was opened?", "A deleted scene was shot where Imam, the wise man translating the markings on the headpiece of the Staff of Ra also translates another set of markings, which gives a warning about not looking into the Ark. Since this scene is not in the movie, it is a little confusing as to how Indy knew that he could only survive the opening of the Ark by closing his eyes. Perhaps he simply remembered the picture of the Ark he showed to the army officers; in it, an entire army is decimated, but the people carrying the Ark remain unaffected. So he may have concluded that opening the Ark is not necessarily deadly to anyone in close proximity, and that it is the visual contact that was deadly. Another option is that he remembered a relevant passage from the Bible (1 Samuel 6:19), where God \"smote\" the men of Beth Shemesh for looking into the Ark. Plus, there's a brief moment when Marcus Brody says the light from the Ark could lay waste to everything it touched, further warning of the Ark's power."]], "0066921": [["A Note Regarding Spoilers", "The following FAQ entries may contain spoilers.

However, in a 1986 Introduction to the first American edition of the book to contain the final chapter, Anthony Burgess says \"A human being is endowed with free will. He can use this to choose between good and evil. If he can only perform good or only perform evil, then he is a clockwork orange\u2014meaning that he has the appearance of an organism lovely with colour and juice but is in fact only a clockwork toy to be wound up by God or the Devil.\" He goes on to say \"the important thing is moral choice.\" When Alex cannot choose to perform good or evil (after the Ludovico treatment), he has become a clockwork orange. Burgess also states that the Malaysian word \"orang\" means \"man\" in English, so \"_A Clockwork Orange_ (qv)\" means \"a clockwork man\", which is what Alex has become by the end of the film, figuratively."], ["Why do Alex and his droogs drink milk?", "The milk has drugs in it. If you listen closely, Alex names all the drugs during the opening scene: \"The Korova Milk Bar sells Milk Plus: milk plus synthemesc, vellocet, or drencrom, which is what we were drinking. This will sharpen you up and make you ready for a bit of the old ultraviolence.\" You can also see the names of the drugs spelled out on the walls of the Bar behind them in the first shot. Novelist Anthony Burgess has stated that Alex drinking milk is symbolic of his infantile, child-like nature. \"Synthemesc\" is synthetic mescaline; \"vellocet\" is methedrine/speed, and \"drencrom\" is adrenochrome, all very powerful drugs which would cause the user to lose impulse control. Both mescaline and adrenochrome act as hallucinogens, and in addition, adrenochrome can amplify the effects of methedrine, making them the perfect additives for ultra-violence."], ["What's that weird language they speak?", "It's called Nadsat. It's a language the author made up for the book, largely comprised of phonetically pronounced Russian words. The word nadsat itself is the Russian suffix for \"-teen\". Burgess was a linguist, and aware of the evolution of slang, did not want Alex and his Droogs to use (then) contemporary slang terms for fear of the book becoming dated. He used his knowledge of Russian to create the imaginary street-jargon used by the gangs as a way of ensuring that this would not happen. When the book was translated into Russian, the Russian words were replaced with their English counterparts; ironically, at the time, the Russian subculture equivalent to American hippies already spoke in a similar jargon, giving the book another (albeit unintentional) layer. A full list can be found here. Early American mass-market paperback editions of the book had a nadsat glossary in the back. The newer trade-paperback edition eliminated the glossary."], ["Did Alex only get 14 years for murder?", "A life sentence in the United Kingdom is 14 years at minimum. After that, the prisoner may be paroled or released at the court's discretion, but until that happens they will remain in prison indefinitely. In extreme cases, life can mean exactly that: life imprisonment, with no chance for parole. As Alex's crime was vicious, he would have served the full 14 year sentence. Because the attack on the woman was premeditated, the charge would have been most likely have been murder, not manslaughter which carries a shorter term of imprisonment. Although the charge theoretically could have been reduced to manslaughter (the assault on the woman was indeed premeditated, but the murder itself was accidental), the fact that Alex was willing to undergo the Ludovico treatment rather than just wait out his sentence points to a murder conviction."], ["Were the women from the record store/woman at the end raped?", "No, they followed Alex back to his room and undressed willingly. The woman at the end is on top, and isn't trying to get away. But in the book, the girls are very young (10 years old), and Alex got them drunk and raped them."], ["What about the masturbation scene?", "Some people don't believe there is one, but most believe when Alex listens to Beethoven in his room after the rape, he's masturbating. In the book, it's made clear he's naked during this part, but he also says that his hands were behind his head. McDowell's commentary track on the 2007 DVD release sheds a bit more light on this issue: He mentions that he wasn't masturbating and that it wasn't Kubrick's intention. Malcolm says that he was just taking his boots off, hence the movement of his shoulders. However, it can still be implied that Alex was gratifying himself."], ["Why did Alex have to stand behind the white line while registering in prison if he could barely reach the podium?", "It's a method of humiliation. The guards are deliberately making Alex look submissive and are conditioning him to the rules of the prison. If Alex steps out of line, either consciously or unconsciously, he'll be reprimanded or punished."], ["If the \"Singin' in the Rain\" bit was added just before filming, how was the writer originally supposed to find out that Alex is the guy who assaulted him and his wife?", "In the film, Stanley Kubrick originally planned for F. Alexander ('Patrick Magee' (qv)) to discover that Alex was the person who raped his wife by having Alex mention the word \"Horrorshow.\" Alex would have been talking, and would have said \"Horrorshow\" in the conversation, making F. Alexander suspicious, and finally he would have realized who Alex really was after getting Alex to repeat the word again and again. However, this was changed on set, just before filming. In the book, the writer finds out because Alex has knowledge of the house when he is taken in. Specifically, Alex expresses his surprise when the author says he will call his friends on a telephone (Remember, the first thing said to Alex in the first encounter was that they didn't have a telephone). From there, the author puts the pieces together from further conversation with Alex, finally realizing the truth after Alex gets upset at the mention of the word \"dim\". This is when F. Alexander starts to become really suspicious\u2014when Alex mistakenly mentions the word \"dim\" and the writer remembers that name."], ["What is the model of the car that Alex & the Droogs drive around before they attack the writer and his wife?", "Alex calls the car a \"Durango '95\" but it's actually a 1970 M-505 Adams Brothers Probe 16. The car was one of only three prototypes built and is one of the rarest cars in the world. More info on it can be found here and here."], ["What became of Pete, the third of Alex's \"droogs\"?", "In the film, it is never made clear where Pete ends up. We learn that Georgie and Dim have gone on to become police officers, who take their first opportunity to beat Alex within an inch of his life (post-treatment, Alex can no longer defend himself, which is public knowledge via the newspapers), but the subject of Pete is never revisited. In the original novel (The film version uses the original U.S. issue of the book, that removes chapter 21, the final chapter, which is why you don't see Pete after Alex's treatment in the film), Alex has a chance encounter with Pete (who is almost 20 years old) and finds that his former droog has grown up quite a bit: He's found a woman with whom to settle down and no longer speaks in Nadsat. According to Burgess' vision, this makes Alex question his path and purpose. This takes place after Alex has declared himself \"cured\", and has returned to a life of crime with a new set of Droogs. Seeing his old friend Pete all grown up and living a normal life, Alex is driven to consider giving up his days as a thug and cleaning up his act once and for all. This gives the faithful reader a sense of a moral that is not presented in the original U.S. release of the novel, and therefore the film, that \"one cannot be forced to change, but one must decide to change on their own\". Also, in the novel, Georgie dies whilst Alex is in prison (while trying to escape a robbery, he trips and a man beats him to death), and the other policemen with Dim that beats up Alex is in fact, Billy Boy (the gang leader Alex and his Droogs have a fight with near the start)."], ["Did McDowell almost drown in the \"trough\" scene?", "It has been written in the past that 'Malcolm McDowell' (qv) nearly drowned in the trough scene, where his former droogs, Georgie and Dim, dunk him into an animal trough filled with dirty water and beat him with a nightstick for nearly a minute of screen time. The rumour was that McDowell's breathing apparatus failed. This isn't true. In the Warner Brothers DVD, McDowell does a commentary track and talks about how he used an oxygen tank while he was under the water. He never mentions that it failed or that he almost drowned. Also on one of the documentaries on the DVD, the commentator mentions that McDowell did 28 takes of that scene, so the tank must have been working."], ["Why wasn't Alex affected by his singing of \"Singin' in the Rain\" in the Writer's bathtub after being brought into the Writer's house in the last third of the film?", "We all know that the improvisation of \"Singin' in the Rain\" during the rape of the Writer's wife was an on-the-set decision by 'Malcolm McDowell' (qv) but why didn't he get sick whenever he absent mindedly began to sing the song while in the bathtub after being brought in to safety into the Writer's house near the end of the film? We have to look at the reason he should have gotten sick in the first place: The Ludevico Treatment. We know that Alex was shocked when, during the treatment sessions, he heard Beethoven's music during the footage of Nazi Germany. That means that Alex's mind began to relate the music of Beethoven to violence. The connection of Beethoven to violence is used by the Writer in the torturing of Alex near the end of the film. But since the Beethoven / violence connection is used, what about \"Singin in the Rain\"? Should Alex have gotten sick, as it was related to an actual act of sexual violence in the film itself? It is questionable, but Alex should have gotten sick, like the writer quivering in sickness hearing the song from Alex for the second time. This could have been an oversight of Stanley Kubrick himself.\n\nWhen we look at the novel, we get much more of the effects from the administration of the Ludevico Treatment. Alex couldn't listen to any music, of any type, at all. He also couldn't read the Bible any more either, due to the sex and violence contained within the good book, which was the reason that Alex began reading the Bible in jail (before starting the treatment) in the first place. Since many of the goofs in the film are \"intentional\" goofs by Kubrick himself and intended to disorient the viewer, this one would be an oversight by Kubrick, and not a flaw to confuse people who watch the film."], ["How does the movie end?", "When it comes to light that the government is responsible for Alex's attempted suicide due to their attempts at brainwashing him as a means of crime reform, the newspapers and public opinion take an unfavorable view of the government's attempt at changing Alex's inherent nature. After a period of psychological manipulation and testing, Alex is visited in the hospital by the Interior Minister ('Anthony Sharp' (qv)), who promises to take good care of him, find him a well-paying job, and compensate him for his suffering. In return, Alex promises to consider the government a friend and to help change public opinion of them. The minister then presents Alex with large bouquets of flowers and a large stereo system blasting Beethoven's Ninth Symphony, while multiple photographers takes photos of alex and the Minster chumming it up together. In the final scene, Alex fantasizes having sex while \"the public\" watches and applauds. In a voiceover, Alex exclaims, \"I was cured, all right!\""], ["What happened during Alex's dream that people were playing around in his head?", "It wasn't a dream, the doctors and nurses were in his head, fixing his treatment, so he'd no longer get sick at the thought of sex and violence. The Ludovico treatment was being blasted by the media as inhumane and the doctors were trying to restore Alex to his former demeanor."], ["Did Alex go back to his old ways at the end?", "That's left ambiguous in the film, however he was given back the power to choose to do good or evil. That's what he means by \"I was cured alright.\" In the book, he joins a new gang of droogs after he was cured, but later decides that it might be time to give up this lifestyle, get married and settle down."], ["Is Alex's real surname DeLarge or Burgess?", "Despite the newspapers giving his last name as \"Burgess,\" it appears that \"Alexander DeLarge\" is his real name. While some viewers believe Alex to be mocking the prison authorities by giving this as his name, both Mr. Alexander and the Minister of the Interior refer to him as \"Mr. DeLarge\" at various points in the film, indicating that this is his real name. The \"Burgess\" seen in newspapers was simply an inside joke by Kubrick, a reference to Anthony Burgess."], ["Is the man who helps Frank Alexander in the end his lover?", "No. Julian ('David Prowse' (qv)) is just there because Frank Alexander was afraid to be alone after the rape and death of his wife. Julian was a bodyguard as well as a helpmate strong enough to carry him in his wheelchair. According to Prowse, he and 'Patrick Magee' (qv) were not told specifically by Kubrick what their relationship was, so they played it under the assumption that Julian was a close relative, possibly Alexander's nephew."], ["Is it true Kubrick changed the ending of the book?", "No. The original version of the book has 21 chapters. Back in 1962, the American publisher decided not to include the last chapter, as the novel would then finish on an ambiguous note. Burgess, whilst not pleased at the interference, accepted the change. Kubrick's film was adapted from the version of the book published in the United States, and therefore the movie has a different ending. The novel was eventually released in a new edition that restored the last chapter."], ["Was this film banned in the UK?", "Contrary to popular belief, _A Clockwork Orange_ (qv) was never banned in the UK. The BBFC (British Board of Film Classification) classified it as an X-rating in 1971. When first released, many people in Britain were disgusted by the film as the sexual violence was considered to be extreme. Throughout 1972 and 1973, several violent crimes in Britain were said to be influenced by the film. These included an old man beaten to death in an underpass, a sixteen year old boy wearing Alex's uniform beating up a younger boy and a young woman raped by men chanting 'Singing in the Rain'. With pressure on director Stanley Kubrick to ban the film, Kubrick withdrew _A Clockwork Orange_ (qv) from British cinemas in 1973. He said that the film would only be allowed to be seen after his death. During the 1980s and '90s, the only way in which British fans could see the film was if they ordered it on VHS from other countries, usually France. In 1993, the Scala Cinema club in London screened the film without Kubrick's permission. At Kubrick's insistence, Warner Bros sued the Scala club causing them to become bankrupt and eventually close. Stanley Kubrick died in 1999 and the movie was re-classified with an 18-rating by the BBFC. _A Clockwork Orange_ (qv) was eventually re-released in British cinemas in 2000 and released on VHS and DVD in the UK later that year."], ["Why is this rated X?", "At the time it was released, the ratings system was quite different than it is now. The only ratings were \"G (General)\", \"M (Mature)\", \"R (Restricted)\", and \"X\" (extreme or crossing the line). \"M\" and \"R\" were roughly synonymous\u2014both denoted \"adult\" content, with anyone being admitted to M-rated films and R-rated films requiring an adult to accompany anyone under 16 years old. X-rated films were those considered \"too extreme\" for anyone under 16, and denoted that theaters were not to permit anyone under the age of 16 even with a guardian. To this end, the sexual violence featured in the first thirty minutes of the film, and the \"Ludovico Treatment\" rape footage, were considered too graphic for anyone under 16 to see, hence the \"X\" rating. Because the X rating was not copyrighted by the Motion Picture Association of America (MPAA), it could be used by any film distributor, and the adult film industry began to self-rate its own films \"X\" in order to avoid having to submit them to the MPAA for rating and face the films being banned outright due to anti-pornography laws in the early 1970s. Soon, the \"X\" became a marketing tool for the pornography industry, with (imaginary) ratings of XX and XXX being given to adult films by their producers to denote levels of sexual \"extremity.\" In response, the MPAA, for all intents and purposes, ceased using the X rating for non-pornographic films; _A Clockwork Orange_ (qv) and Midnight Cowboy, two mainstream films which had been given the X rating for sexually explicit content (only to win rave critical reviews) were summarily re-rated R without any changes made to their content. In 1972, the \"M\" rating was replaced by \"PG\", marking a clearer middle-ground between \"G\" and \"R\" than the \"M\" rating had indicated. (Trivia: The MPAA's NC-17 rating [\"No Children 17 years old or younger\"] has more or less come to supplant the uncopyrighted X rating.)"], ["What is the significance of the illustrations on the DVD cover?", "The person drawn is Alex, and he is holding his britva (razor).

Lila screams, which brings Norman, dressed as his mother, running downstairs and brandishing a knife with which he plans to kill Lila, but Sam stops him. At a conference held several days later, psychiatrist Dr Fred Richman ('Simon Oakland' (qv)), after interviewing Norman, explains how Norman killed his mother and her lover ten years ago and how the guilt caused his personality to split into two sides Norman and his mother.

The \"camera\" pans along with it, and we catch sight of the edge of a toilet and a full view of the pull-cord used for flushing it. Also, in the Van Beuren cartoon short, _Piano Tooners (1932)_ (qv), a tuner takes a sour musical note (which cartoon magic has made into a living creature) and flushes it down the toilet.

We spend far less time with Mary Crane in Robert Bloch's book than we do with Marion in the movie. _The City of the Dead (1960)_ (qv), a British horror picture that was released three months after Hitchcock's film, seems to have independently hit upon the idea of killing its protagonist before the film is half over.

She also has moleskin taped to her, which protected her modesty from the technical crew. We see her bare back, but she is never shown in any real state of nudity. Her nude stand-in is shot from overhead in such a way as to show that she is indeed nude. But her hips are turned to avoid showing the pubic area; and one arm across her chest shields any real view of her breasts. After the killer has fled, and Marion Crane slides down the wall, she reaches out and grabs the shower curtain with her right hand. Look carefully at the close-up insert shot of the hand coming into frame and clutching the shower curtain. While your attention is drawn to the hand and curtain on the left side of the screen (both in sharp focus), look again at the fuzzy, out-of-focus grey and white areas in the background to the middle right. It may take adjusting the contrast and several viewings, but there is indisputably a pair of naked breasts in the background of the shot. In an interview in Microsoft's Cinemania, 'Janet Leigh' (qv) admitted that she did appear nude at one point although unintentionally. The moleskin was affixed to her body with glue. The numerous takes caused her to spend a lot of time in the hot water of the shower, and the heat caused the glue to eventually lose its grip. She could feel the moleskin sliding down her breasts.

However, because of the Prince's bad attitude and unwelcoming manner, the castle has no guests for a long time until Belle arrives (which is why they make such a fuss over her in the Be Our Guest number). The torn painting in the west wing shows the Prince. in human form, as a young man, not an eleven year old. It's possible Lumiere means it's been ten years since he and the staff have entertained guests, and that the transformation only occurred three or four years previously.\n\nAnother possibility is that because of the curse, aging was stopped for those in the castle, with the exception of the Beast himself. Furthermore, it could be that when the Beast reaches the age of 21, not only will he be a beast forever, but he will never grow older."], ["What are the differences between the Theatrical Version and the Special Extended Version?", "The movie was restored for its rerelease in 2002.

Coupled with the money that Daniel never paid Eli, $5000 of an agreed-upon $10,000 total and that Eli was really a fake in his faith-healing -- Daniel roars at him about not being able to restore HW's hearing -- and that Eli's motivation in having Daniel be baptized was to humiliate him publicly, it's no wonder that Daniel cracks in the last scene and kills Eli.\n\nAdditionally, the fact that H.W. Plainview ('Russell Harvard' (qv)) was now going to be a rival to Daniel caused more fury and anger in him, which Daniel projected onto Eli. When Eli visited and told Daniel about Mr. Bandy's land, Daniel had already drained the areas with the wells he'd drilled surrounding that area. Daniel wanted nothing to do with Eli. He killed Eli out of hate. The last line \"I'm finished!\" meant he was finished with his guest along with his life. It could also mean that Daniel had eliminated his last possible source of competition, Eli.\n\nAnother explanation lies in Daniel's view of family. He accepted H.W. as his son, as he had control over the child. As H.W. became autonomous, he withdrew from Daniel, destroying Daniel's attempt at family. Eli arrives, telling that he and Daniel are now brothers -- HW had married Eli's younger sister. As Daniel never sought this creation of family with Eli, he decided to destroy it. A popular explanation of Daniel's killing of Eli and the meaning of the film's final line is that throughout the movie, Daniel devolves into a purely evil human being. From the beginning where he is so poor that he is willing to crawl on his back for miles to claim a silver find to the end where he has become rich and is now almost completely insane, Daniel has descended into becoming truly demonic. Ultimately, he is so evil that the murder of Eli means absolutely nothing to him, and his final line, \"I'm finished,\" cements the fact that he has \"finished\" his descent into evil. Another interpretation to the final line could be that Daniel meant that he was finished \"eating\". This could either mean finished eating the meal that can be seen when the two were talking, just before the murder or that he was done \"eating\" Eli as Daniel can be heard saying \"I told you I would eat you up.\" while he chases Eli around the bowling lane.\n\nIt also can be said that Daniel took Eli as a competitor who was making money without any hard work by using Daniel's money. Daniel sates that he has a competition in him and he does not want anyone to succeed. By killing Eli he took revenge of his humiliation and also removed a person who was succeeding."], ["Why does Daniel cover his face with the napkin in the restaurant?", "He didn't want his son to know he was talking business with Tilford.

We are forced to speculate on Plainview's motivations for taking & keeping H.W., though he clearly does not want the fact he is not the boy's biological father to be made public (this would be why he avoids discussion of the boy's mother). Toward the end of the film, Daniel states that he adopted H.W. in order to have a \"sweet face\" when purchasing land -- if he presents HW at meetings with communities (like the one early in the film) or at private meetings with individual land owners, it will make him seem more human and less like the conniving, greedy man he really is.

As for non-Greenwood music, classical pieces by Arvo Part and Johannes Brahms are used in a few places, such as the final scene in the bowling alley and the spudding of the well, but the brunt of the score is Greenwood's original compositions.

Wouldn't it cause a bigger problem?", "Two things happen when the barrels of dynamite go off: 1. the explosion causes a shockwave that forces the oxygen out of the immediate area for a short period, depriving the flames of a fuel source -- the fire at a well needs both the oil as a consistent fuel source but also needs oxygen to burn above the source. 2. It collapses some of the housing structure and probably some of the mud and soil around the opening, sealing the well shut and preventing another gusher. The method that Daniel's men use is quite dangerous but Daniel has several years of experience & he'd probably trained his workers in the safest way to do it.

The bomb would produce enough nuclear fallout to wipe out all life on Earth within 10 months; except, perhaps, for those within fallout shelters such as those discussed by the President and his advisers in the final scene of the film. The device resembles the real-life Soviet \"Dead Hand\" system, developed decades later, in the 1980s. The system was capable, without human intervention or authorisation, of automatically launching nuclear missiles at predesignated targets if it detected a nuclear attack on Russia. It is believed to still be in use by Russia today, but by most accounts it is only activated during rare crisis situations in which a nuclear attack is thought to be imminent. In the book \"Red Alert\", on which the film is based, the doomsday device was a number of hydrogen bombs hidden in the Ural mountains, each with a cobalt shroud.

The theory goes like this: The Device was hooked up to enough bombs to create the fatal \"doomsday shroud\" that would eventually annihilate all life on earth. It was also unstoppable once it was triggered by a nuclear explosion. The desired effect was that no one would want to risk attacking Russia for fear of setting off the device, especially since no amount of negotiation with the Russians afterwards could possibly stop the thing from going off. As Strangelove said, the whole point of the Device is lost when it is kept a secret, which is one of the ultimate ironies of the film.

The Ambassador's sneaky photography is mirrored on the Americans' side by Buck Turgidson, who proclaims that they \"cannot allow a mineshaft gap!\" In this, he means that he truly believes that in the century or so of hiding in mineshafts, people will still be very concerned about staying one step ahead of Russia.

It seemed irrelevant.", "It's never fully explained in the movie, but there are subtle hints that the scene did have a significant role in the plot; Mike's fragile emotional state obviously startles Marge. After her friend informs her about Mike's problems and the fact that he was never married to Linda as he said, you can see that she becomes very sad and concerned about him. This is most evident in the scene where she is eating Hardee's in her car. As she is thinking about this, her mind apparently wanders off into other areas including the case she is working on. At the very end of that scene, you can see a slight but noticable expression on her face that indicates a light bulb just went off in her head. This is because she has connected Mike's frantic behavior with the similar, though much less severe, behavior by Jerry in her first meeting with him. You will recall that Jerry displayed a certain amount of nervousness that would have illustrated to someone looking closely that he was a bit panicked (for example, pausing and remarking about Brainerd instead of answering her question about whether a vehicle had been stolen) . Marge apparently didn't notice it at the time but after thinking about her encounter with Mike she is then able to connect the dots. Soon after, she goes back to speak with Jerry again.\n\nIt is also thought that Marge, although being an experienced police officer, realizes she may not always know when she is being lied to. After discovering that everything Mike said to her was a lie, she questions her police work and thinks that maybe Jerry was lying to her as well. This is why she goes back to question Jerry again.\n\n"], ["What were Jerry's schemes?", "Let's do a little character evaluation on Jerry:\n\n1. Jerry is shown to be spineless, inept and incompetent in pretty much everything he tries. He is basically a hapless loser who tries but just can't get anything done right. The Coen Brothers have described Jerry as an \"amateur criminal\". This is first evidenced in the scene where Jerry is finalizing a sale for a new car to a couple and the man is infuriated that Jerry added the $500 TruCoat onto the $19,500 car and charged him for it even though the man specifically stated he didn't want it. Instead of Jerry conceding and taking the cost off the man's bill, he says he'd go talk to his boss about it. However seeing as Jerry is the boss (he later tells Marge that he is the sales manager), we see that he steps into the break-room to talk to a co-worker to make it seem like he just spoke to \"his boss\". When he comes back,Jerry says he could get $100 knocked off the cost of the TruCoat, infuriating his customer even further.\n\n2. We also see that Jerry's father-in-law Wade, who owns the car dealership Jerry works at, practically despises him and makes little effort to hide it. Wade does not like Jerry because he is aware of Jerry's craftiness or of the thought that Jerry may have married his daughter, Jean, just because he is wealthy, which is later shown that with the exception of his and Jean's son, Scott, Jerry shows little or no concern or affection for both his father-in-law or his own wife.\n\n3. So we can assume Jerry was likely involved in some sort of business scheme or schemes where he lost a lot of money, because he apparently didn't know what he was himself getting into. It is speculated that sometime before the events in the film, he created fake invoices for vehicles he \"sold\" at the dealership even though they didn't actually exist.\n\n4. Jerry sent the sold invoices along with a insurance loan request off to the dealership finance company with illegible VIN numbers... somehow hoping they wouldn't notice. The finance company, GMAC, calls Jerry at least twice on-camera to confront him about the accounting irregularities and wanted the VIN numbers as evidence of the sales or else they would pull the loans on the vehicles which total $320,000. The reasons for Jerry doing this remain unknown. Speculation from various viewers say that Jerry probably embezzled money from the dealership bank accounts and then borrowed the money from GMAC to replace the money he stole. Another speculation is that Jerry wanted the $320,000 loan to pay off other creditors he owes money too, or that he either spent or gambled the $320,000 loan away for personal use (though there is nothing in the film to suggest that Jerry has a gambling problem).\n\n5. Clearly, Jerry knew that this plan only had a limited run so, through the association of a mechanic employee and ex-convict, Shep Proudfoot, Jerry meets and hires Grimsrud and Showalter to kidnap his wife in order to ask for a ransom of $80,000 from Jerry's father-in-law which Jerry will split with the kidnappers so Jerry could show as proof of car sales for GMAC. Though Jerry tries to call off the kidnapping at one point because he thinks that a real estate deal he brings to Wade's attention will get him out of the bind he is in financially. But Wade takes the deal solely for himself and offers Jerry a measly finder's fee. Jerry is too late to call off the kidnapping anyway and so Jerry tells Wade that the ransom is $1,000,000 (so that Jerry can use $320,000 of it to pay back GMAC when they demand their money back, and probably to spend the rest for personal use).\n\n6. Through a course of events, which includes Grimsrud and Showalter shooting and killing a Minnesota State Police trooper who pulled them over for not having temporary vehicle tags on their car (followed by Grimsrud chasing down and shooting two passing motorists who see Showalter moving the trooper's body off the road), Showalter calls Jerry and says he wants the entire $80,000 ransom, leaving Jerry with nothing. Of course everyone knows that Jerry is in no position to negotiate, threaten or demand anything from Showalter and Grimsrud. Being inept and having poorly thought out of this kidnapping plan, Jerry doesn't have anything on the kidnappers to use for leverage, but they have everything on Jerry, as Grimsrud and Showalter know that Jerry personally met and hired them to kidnap his wife and if the police should capture them first, they can always rat on Jerry by claiming that he was the mastermind of this whole thing. Jerry knows that he has no choice but to agree to any demands the kidnappers threaten him with.\n\n7. Once again, this plan backfires on Jerry because his father-in-law knows how unreliable Jerry is and doesn't trust him with the ransom money (rightfully so) and insists on going to the exchange himself. Jerry, being spineless and afraid of his father-in-law, does not insist on going in his place or even going with him, even though he also knows that Showalter is also very pissed off. For some reason, Jerry decides to go to the meeting anyways and he finds Wade's body, which he puts in his car trunk (and possibly he knows that Wade is dead as he's entering the parking garage, given that he passes a bloodied Carl going there). After this, Jerry goes back into work as if everything was hunky-dory until Marge goes back to interview him again. Jerry panics and flees the scene. He is eventually apprehended at a motel in North Dakota. As a final irony, Jerry, being incompetent to the end, uses the same 'Jerry Anderson' alias that he uses when checking into the _Fargo_ (qv), North Dakota inn where he first meets Grimsrund and Showalter.. thus enabling the police to easily track him down."], ["Why did Carl Showalter bury the money and not keep it for himself?", "Carl Showalter intended to keep the rest of the money for himself which is precisely why he buried it. The shots showing the fence on the left and right show that he did not have any type of identifying marker to find the money again. This is why he sticks the windshield ice scraper into the ground. Carl's plan was to hide the money, return with the $80,000 to split evenly, then to take the car and return to the spot where he buried it to reclaim the remaining $920,000 giving him a grand total of $960,000 and Grimsrud would have never been any the wiser."], ["Why did Showalter argue with Grimsrud about paying for half of the car?", "At the end of the film, Showalter now has $1,000,000. Of course, instead of telling Grimsrud about this, he takes out $80,000 in order to bring to Grimsrud to split with him, as Grimsrud is only expecting a cut of $40,000. As far as Grimsrud knows, Showalter is making good on their arrangement. Showalter says he's taking the car they took for the job and that Grimsrud could have his old truck and they must part ways. Grimsrud says they need to split the car by Showalter paying Grimsrud for half the car's value if he wants the car for himself. Showalter, infuriated with the notion, reminds Grimsrud that he took a bullet in the face picking up the ransom, and threatens Grimsrud by reminding him that he still has a gun. This prompts Grimsrud to run outside and kill Showalter with an axe and dispose of his body in a wood chipper, leaving him with all $80,000.\n\nMany people would wonder why would Showalter bother arguing with Grimsrud about paying him out of his cut when he's got another $920,000 buried in the snow to pick up later that Grimsrud would never know about. Basically what it comes down to is a clear and simple case of greed from both men. Showalter doesn't want to give any more money to Grimsrud than the agreed upon amount because he feels he did all the work and took a bullet across the face for his troubles, while Grimsrud simply looked after Jerry's wife. In the end, Grimsrud couldn't even do that and decided to kill her. Even still, Grimsrud wanted a bigger cut by making a case of the new car that Jerry left them and wanted Showalter to pay for half the car's value. While Grimsrud barely speaks throughout the film, it's obvious that he's a psychopath and has no qualms about killing anyone so it's possible that he was planning on killing Showalter anyway just to steal his half of the $80,000, although it's interesting to note that Grimsrud didn't seem intent on killing Showalter until after Showalter started threatening him.\n\nKeep in mind as well that both Grimsrud and Showalter are petty criminals, and that their status as such may be the result of them viewing the world from a perspective that differs from that of the average person, as well as an inflated sense of entitlement and tendency to attach an out-sized significance to the kind of affront that the average person would find irritating but nonetheless dismiss relatively quickly (in other words, an inability to \"keep things in perspective\"). There are multiple, even more absurd examples in the film this mindset, including in the opening scene during the discussion about whether the agreed-on meeting time in the bar had been 7:30 or 8:30, Showalter's outrage over the $4 charge to exit the airport parking lot (and apparent need to \"get even\" with the lot cashier by insulting him), and so on."], ["How did Grimsrud kill Jerry's wife?", "It's never known for certain, but it appears he either split her head open on the side of the countertop, or possibly slashed her throat and the blood seen on the counter is arterial spray.

Suffice to say that, in the early part of the 20th century, it was noted that epileptics who suffered from convulsions rarely suffered from schizophrenia. The thought was that the convulsions were protective. Consequently, many forms of inducing convulsions were tried, e.g., with insulin (as in Nash's case), but electroconvulsive therapy appeared to be the safest and most controllable way to induce convulsions, and the results were often dramatic.

Perhaps she did something to screw them over that we were never shown, and they had a good reason to 'get back' at her. We do not know the whole score in the first volume, so she is just an unknown killer.

The film generally does not take a hard, realistic tone. It's possible that it could have been near the beginning of Buck's eight hour (or possibly longer) shift when The Bride took him out. Perhaps the next nurse coming in decided not to check on them for a while because s/he had other things to do, and no one found the bloody mess in the room for over thirteen hours. They were in the coma ward, where nurses possibly didn't check on the patients that often. By the time he was found, with all the usual shock of the discovery of a double homicide, it's entirely possible they didn't get around to checking his truck by the time the Bride left. Not to mention, if they did check for his truck they would see that it was still there, and possibly wouldn't check inside. Seeing as how the truck wasn't stolen, they may not have found it necessary to check it.

That said, by the timeline the movie sets up, it's actually impossible for Vernita to not have been already pregnant during the Two Pines massacre. The Bride woke up four years, six months later and Nikki was four years old in Kill Bill I. Thus, Vernita would have to have been at least three months pregnant at the time. The doctor could still have been the father (although how he got hooked up with the still-an-assassin Vernita is unknown but not entirely implausible) and it's not a plothole that The Bride would have no idea Vernita was pregnant, since they'd been out of touch."], ["Why did Hanzo throw the baseball at The Bride?", "Likely to test to see if The Bride had any skill with a katana, which she proves by slicing the baseball in half."], ["Why is Hattori Hanzo upset with Bill?", "Obviously, we don't know, seeing as how it wasn't explained.

A small snow storm therefore may have started when The Bride first came inside. For example, when O-Ren walks over the dance floor with the few Crazy 88s towards the beginning of the scene, there is a nice shot of a window and you can clearly see the snow falling. On an artistic level, this scene was written as an homage to the film Lady Snowblood, which Kill Bill was heavily inspired by. In said film, a similar setting is used for a swordfight. And it also adds to the slight undertone of mysticism throughout the film."], ["What does the weird writing say on the bottom of The Bride's sneakers at the end of the film?", "It says \"Fuck U.\" The sneakers are Asics Onitsuka Tiger Tai Chi model.

There are several links between all of the movies that can be made. The best link is the character of #Earl McGraw# (qv) who appears in all of the movie's plots. McGraw dies at the start of _From Dusk Till Dawn_ (qv), so this would place From Dusk Til Dawn's events at the end of the timeline. Then there is #Jasper# (qv) who is alive in the _Death Proof_ (qv) segment of _Grindhouse_ (qv), but dies in Kill Bill Vol 1. There is also the link of #El Wray# (qv) from the _Planet Terror_ (qv) segment of _Grindhouse_ (qv) and the town that #Seth Gecko# (qv) and #Richie Gecko# (qv) were heading to in From Dusk Til Dawn, which was also called \"#El Wray# (qv)\". Another link is #Dr. Dakota Block# (qv) who appears in both the _Death Proof_ (qv) and _Planet Terror_ (qv) segments of _Grindhouse_ (qv), and this is the best place to start. Dr Dakota Block is also the daughter of #Earl McGraw# (qv) and sister of #Edgar McGraw# (qv) who also appears in Kill Bill Vol 1 and _From Dusk Till Dawn 2: Texas Blood Money_ (qv).\n\nFrom this you can start to piece together the chronology of the universe. The events of _Death Proof_ (qv) must happen before the events of _Planet Terror_ (qv). This can be assumed by the relationship between Dr Dakota Block and #Earl McGraw# (qv) that is frayed in _Death Proof_ (qv) and most of _Planet Terror_ (qv), but they do make up by the end of _Planet Terror_ (qv). Also the lack of \"sickos\" in _Death Proof_ (qv) would suggest this is before _Planet Terror_ (qv). Plus, Block leaves at the end of _Planet Terror_ (qv), but is back working in the hospital in _Death Proof_ (qv). There is also a mention \"in memory of\" over the radio of #Jungle Julia# (qv) from _Death Proof_ (qv) in the events of _Planet Terror_ (qv). So far, we have (1) _Death Proof_ (qv) and (2) _Planet Terror_ (qv).\n\nThen we can move on to #Jasper# (qv). As he is alive in _Death Proof_ (qv) but dies in Kill Bill Vol 1, that would place the (current) events of Kill Bill Vol 1 and Kill Bill Vol 2 after the events of _Death Proof_ (qv). Thus, (1) _Death Proof_ (qv), (2) _Planet Terror_ (qv), (3) Kill Bill Vol 1, and (4) Kill Bill Vol 2. Then onto #Earl McGraw# (qv) who is alive in _Death Proof_ (qv), _Planet Terror_ (qv), and Kill Bill Vol 1 but is killed in From Dusk Til Dawn, leading us to (1) _Death Proof_ (qv), (2) _Planet Terror_ (qv), (3) Kill Bill Vol 1, (4) Kill Bill Vol 2, and (5) From Dusk Til Dawn. But you have to include From Dusk Til Dawn 2: Texas Blood Money and _From Dusk Till Dawn 3: The Hangman's Daughter_ (qv). #Edgar McGraw# (qv) makes reference to the events and death of his father Earl in FDTD2: Texas Blood Money, which obviously sets this film after From Dusk Til Dawn. Then FDTD3: The Hangman's Daughter is actually a prequel set in the 1800's, therefore it's the earliest of the connections.\n\nIn sum, chronologically the films go: (1) From Dusk Til Dawn 3: The Hangman's Daughter, (2) _Death Proof_ (qv), (3) _Planet Terror_ (qv), (4) Kill Bill Vol 1, (5) Kill Bill Vol 2, (6) From Dusk Til Dawn, and (7) From Dusk Til Dawn 2: Texas Blood Money."], ["What Tarantino characters are related?", "Vincent Vega (Pulp Fiction) and Victor Vega (Reservoir Dogs) are brothers.\n\nLaurence Dimmick a.k.a.

In the film, the criminals are rounded up without any evidence specifically pointing to them. The police are hoping to randomly get one of them to confess. Thus, they are the \"usual suspects.\" because they have been convicted of crimes that relate to the one for which they have previously been arrested."], ["Who are the \"usual suspects?\"", "The usual suspects are five small-time crooks who are brought together in a police line-up on trumped-up charges.

While they were killing the other men on the ship and looking for the drugs, S\u00f6ze sneaked onto the ship and killed Arturo ('Castulo Guerra' (qv)). Arturo was the one man who could positively identify him, so S\u00f6ze needed him dead."], ["Are there clues to Keyser S\u00f6ze's identity?", "Yes, there are some. One is Verbal's relative position on the night of the attack. He is hiding behind a stack of material on the dock. When Hockney is killed, Verbal would have been the closest person to him. In his testimony, shown in flashback, Verbal supposedly takes cover behind some large spools of rope on the dock as he observes Soze on the boat. However, when the camera zooms in on this area from the opposite side after the explosion, no one is seen peering through the ropes.\n\nIn the opening scene, we see Keyser S\u00f6ze look at a gold pocket watch and produce a gold cigarette lighter. Later, in the scene where the gang threatens Kobayashi, we see Verbal wearing a similar watch. He also collects this watch, along with a gold cigarette lighter, as he leaves the police station, despite having earlier demonstrated his inability to use a similar lighter during his questioning.\n\nIn the interrogation, Verbal comments that when he gets dehydrated his urine becomes thick and lumpy due to a kidney condition. In the opening scene when Keyser S\u00f6ze urinates on the fire, his urine is thick and lumpy.\n\nWhen agent Kujan begins to suggest that Keaton might be the one behind the hit on the docks, Verbal can be seen starting to smile. When Kujan comes around from behind Verbal and looks him in the face, the smile disappears, and Verbal continues to pretend loyalty to Keaton. During the interrogation throughout the movie, although it is easy to miss upon a first viewing, Verbal is seen glancing for a second or two away from Kujan or over Kujan's shoulder at the wall behind him in full view of wanted posters and advertisement flyers of names as Verbal is clearly making up the names of the mysterious associates and contacts such as 'Redfoot' and 'Kobayashi' when Kujan's questioning becomes more intense as it revealed that Verbal Kint is making up (on the spur-of-the-moment) aliases of his co-conspirators as he goes along.\n\nKeyser S\u00f6ze is described by Verbal as being of mixed Turkish/German heritage. \"S\u00f6ze\" is Turkish for \"talks too much,\" or \"verbal.\" \"Keyser\" sounds like the German word \"Kaiser,\" meaning \"emperor,\" while \"Kint\" sounds like \"king.\" Director Bryan Singer has referred to the name as essentially meaning \"The king that talks too much.\"\n\nFinally, one might simply recognize that when S\u00f6ze whispers \"How ya doin' Keaton?\" at the start of the film, the voice is that of Verbal/'Kevin Spacey' (qv). After being thrown on the ground Verbal slips \" I did kill Keaton,\" though Kujan is shouting too loud to hear, and Verbal is able to correct himself by saying \"I did see Keaton get shot.\" Also, when they are listening to the men before the attack on the boat Keaton speculates that they are speaking Russian, Verbal correctly identifies the language as Hungarian, something Soze would obviously know."], ["Is the true identity of Keyser S\u00f6ze ever revealed?", "Yes.

Then they fenced the goods to Redfoot, who then offered them the next job of robbing Saul Berg, which was set up by Kobayashi, etc. etc., which finally led to the events at the end of the film, leaving Verbal the only survivor. When pushed by Kujan, Verbal is adamant that Dean Keaton was his friend and that he wasn't the mastermind behind all the events. When pushed harder by Kujan and given all the facts, Verbal breaks down and admits that they all followed Keaton from the beginning, and that he planned and executed everything. At the very least, the names of those involved, such as Redfoot and Kobayashi, were clearly invented by Verbal on the spot, and his descriptions of where he was when the others got killed during the attack on the boat all appear to be untrue.\n\nHowever, we see that the person who he referred to as \"Kobayashi\" was real, as he picks Verbal up at the end. So it's likely that most of the events that happened were true, but certain aspects may have been fabricated or several of the names changed in order to keep Kujan from being able to trace anyone who had actually been involved with Verbal, thus preserving S\u00f6ze's identity. For example, the incident when \"Kobayashi\" meets with the five of them, gives them their police files, and gives them the assignment of robbing the ship of the supposed cocaine and money, was likely true. In addition, the robbery of Saul Berg and the New York's Finest Taxi Service, and the fact that all five men were rounded up by the police for a lineup, were certainly true, as such facts could be easily confirmed with a few calls to the LAPD and the NYPD. It should also be noted that one of the keys to lying well is to stick as closely to the truth as possible. In this case, it's likely that many of the broad outlines of the story which Verbal told are true."], ["How does the movie end?", "At the end of Kujan's interrogation of Verbal Kint, Kujan looks over the details strewn across the bulletin board, recognizing most of the names from Verbal's account of the events, just as an artist's depiction of Keyser S\u00f6ze makes its way to the police station via fax. It is Verbal Kint. As Verbal walks down the street, his leg straightens out, his fingers uncrimp, and he lights a cigarette.

For example, Verbal doesn't look old enough to have been married with children. However, it wouldn't be too shocking if he was simply Keyser Soze's son continuing the family tradition. The story about Soze shooting his children is true, but Verbal survived by hiding when the thugs came in. In fact, Kobayashi could reasonably have been Keyser Soze. He is clearly in his late 50s or early 60s, making a larger window for him to become one of the most powerful criminals in the world. He's less amazingly steeped in American culture, vernacular and geography for a Turkish crime lord compared to Verbal, he never gets directly involved in his crimes, let alone enters a police station and gives clues that could ruin a cherished identity, preferring instead to have those jobs be carried out by middlemen. Under this theory, Verbal is a conman who is Keyser's infiltrator who helps him stay on top, and also even plays the part of Keyser sometimes, such as on the boat, while \"Kobayashi\" remains completely behind the scenes and his face remains a secret. While not the intended theory, it is plausible."], ["Does Keyser Soze win in the end?", "More or less. Soze has wreaked revenge on those who stole from him, wiped out the opposition and killed the one witness who could identify him. However, the police now have his photograph, fingerprints and DNA and another witness (the surviving Hungarian gangster) who can implicate him. They can also backtrack through the various aspects of the story, checking up on Edie Finnegan's client list, the owners of the hijacked gun truck etc to generate possible leads on Soze's organisation.

Campbell, writing as Don A. Stuart [1910-1971]. It was first published in the August 1938 issues of Astounding Science Fiction magazine, of which Campbell also became editor.

Antarctica has no indigenous people or permanent residents. The Antarctica Treaty, signed by a number of countries in 1959, dictates that Antarctica must only be used for peaceful and/or scientific purposes. Considering the extensive laboratory equipment and presence of several doctors, it is assumed that the men are a part of a scientific team occupying the residence to maintain facilities during the Antarctic winter, as most research occurs during the milder summer months. In Campbell's short story, it was explained that the science crew were there to study and perform experiments regarding the dynamics of magnetics and magnetism in subzero conditions. On the audio commentary to the DVD release of the film, John Carpenter says that he wanted to make a different type of horror film about a group of intelligent, well-read guys going up against an otherworldly, almost unstoppable alien that challenges everything they know. This could then fly in the face of accepted 'slasher' horror ideas where stupid teenage protagonists are picked off one by one. Also, Carpenter had the idea that each of these men had a reason for wanting to be away from the rest of the world. Which is why they are a skeleton crew manning the station during the winter months."], ["What was the Thing doing on the spaceship?", "That question is not answered in the movie. Viewers have suggested several possibilities. _The Thing_ (qv) may have been (1) the pilot, (2) a passenger, (3) a stowaway, (4) part of the cargo, (5) a prisoner being transported to some interstellar prison, or (6) a collected specimen. In an early version of the prequel _The Thing_ (qv), the Thing was one of many species collected by the alien race piloting the spaceship, but this revelation was later dropped from the finished film."], ["Why did the spaceship crash?", "There's really no explanation. The wobbling of the vessel and the flame that bursts from the back end could suggest that something was wrong inside the ship. This theory suggests the spaceship landed on Earth either by accident or as an emergency landing. Apart from the small burst of flames, however, there seems to be nothing wrong with the structure from the outside. The burst of flames could simply have been due to friction from the spaceship entering the Earth's atmosphere. The wobbling could likewise have been caused by proximity to Earth's gravitational pull or simply a mannerism of the craft's flight, such as a maneuver used to slow down the spaceship before entering the Earth's atmosphere. This theory would suggest the spaceship intentionally entered Earth's atmosphere. A third theory is that the spaceship belonged to some other interstellar race that had become infected by the Thing, wreaking havoc not unlike what we see within the film and causing the ship to crash -- perhaps intentionally. This last last chain of events was also included in an early script for the prequel _The Thing_ (qv), but later removed during production, and since this movie was written by a different team of writers, it may not have necessarily been the intention of the writers of the original film."], ["Why did the spaceship crash in Antarctica?", "Three theories have been offered.\n\n1) If the Thing was piloting, crashing in Antarctica was probably an accident as the Thing would certainly choose a landing area with an abundance of lifeforms, although it's been argued that the Thing may have chosen to land in an isolated, inconspicuous place, as landing in a heavily populated area might have resulted in a much more organized and efficient response, wherein the ship would be quarantined, making it impossible to infect another life form. _The Thing_ (qv) may have known the best strategy was to start someplace remote, so virtually nobody would know until it was too late, although it is stated the spacecraft crashed about 100,000 years ago so this would not have been an issue, as man was still very primitive.\n\n2) If the Thing was a stowaway or passenger and had gotten loose and would be attacking the crew, crashing in Antarctica may have been an intentional attempt by the besieged crew to mitigate Thing's ability to spread by landing in a desolate and hostile environment. Antarctica is one of, if not the only, place on the planet in which there are areas with virtually no animal life. Had the Thing been piloting the spaceship, it would have been extremely unlucky to crash in the small section of the Earth in which it would not be able to find life forms to assimilate. This supports the theory that something other than the Thing was piloting the spaceship. Note that the Thing discovered by the Norwegians had attempted to crawl away from the crash site, only to freeze on the ice. It seems unlikely the Thing would intentionally crash in Antarctica and then attempt to crawl away from its ship. This further suggests that however the spaceship ended up in Antarctica, it was either an accident or a deliberate attempt by the crew of the spaceship to avoid letting the Thing reach life forms. But if one takes the implications of the Norwegian camp and what happened to the American camp, it appears history continually repeats itself when coming in contact with the Thing. So it's quite likely the pilot of the ship crashed on purpose to stop the Thing.\n\n3) It was simply a matter of coincidence. Whether the spaceship was deliberately being piloted towards Earth or due to a malfunction, it approached Earth from below, such that its angle of descent just happened to be aimed at Antarctica. As soon as the ship was caught in the Earth gravitational pull, there was little opportunity to deviate from that course."], ["Why were the Norwegians shooting at the dog?", "While we know that the Thing is not affected by bullets, we know that, if it wished to stay hidden in its dog form, it would have to act wounded if hit. The Norwegians were likely trying to slow it down to catch up with it so they could deal with the Thing properly, i.e. explosives and/or fire, hence their use of thermite grenades and the many cans of kerosene they were carrying."], ["What did the Norwegian say to the men at Outpost #31?", "The Norwegian said to MacReady and the men, in Norwegian: \"Se til helvete og kom dere vekk.

It is a Thing that impersonated a Norwegian researcher and got heavily injured during an explosion. In a crippled state, it attached itself to another researcher and fused with him so that the new body could sustain the injured one. It was ultimately burnt with a flamethrower and, in its death struggle, it burst out through a wall, ending up burning and dying outside."], ["What happened to 'Splitface'?", "It assimilated Bennings. The remainder that was left on the table was mostly the dead part that had been burned back at the Norwegian camp. This part, along with the near-assimilated Bennings-thing, were burned. However, the possibility also remains that a part or parts of Splitface could have detached from the body, escaped, and hidden in other areas of the complex, as this theory ties in with the fact that each individual part of a Thing has a goal of self-preservation, as evidenced by the Norris Head-Thing attempting to escape by detaching itself from its body."], ["Who was with Norris and Mac at the crater?", "It was Palmer despite the fact that he has no dialogue during the scene. The script verifies this, as does his attire later in the film when they lock up Blair (he wears the same coat as he nails a board over a window). Palmer was sent because he was the back-up helicopter pilot."], ["When were Norris and Palmer assimilated?", "Earlier in the film, Fuchs reads to MacReady from Blair's notebook that the burnt remains of the alien still contain some cellular activity; they are not dead yet. This implies that the alien could still take any of the science crew although these events are never shown in the film. Later, Fuchs suggests to MacReady that if it only takes a small part of the alien to take over an entire organism, then people should eat out of tincans and only eat meals that they have cooked and prepared by themselves as this would be a way for the alien to prevail, again implying that the alien could get to you slowly just by touching without having to assimilate immediately. There is a scene earlier in the film, in which the infected dog is seen walking into a room, and an unidentified man's shadow can be seen on the opposite wall. This implies that the dog infected either Palmer or Norris at this point."], ["If Palmer and Norris were both Things, why not assimilate Mac at the crater?", "A simple explanation would be that when a Thing assimilates someone, it rips through their clothes (as evident when Windows discovers Bennings' torn and bloody shirt and jacket in the storage room seconds before he sees him being assimilated, and Nauls finding either Palmer's or Norris' torn longjohns in a kitchen trash can stained with dried blood). And given the fact that none of them expected to need extra clothes on a helicopter trip, so if Norris and Palmer were things, if they assimilated Mac, they would have a hard time explaining why he is naked when they get back to camp. So they decided it was best not to take him then. Another theory is that Mac could still have been a thing. Even though he tied everyone down and came up with the hot needle blood test, it might very well have been that the test was a \"crock of shit\" as Childs put it. Then the Palmer Thing sacrificed itself by acting as if the blood test was successful to draw any suspicions away from Mac. However, this theory is less likely as it goes against the very nature of _The Thing_ (qv) (self preservation above all else).\n\nThere are two more possibilities here. The first and probably most logical is that one of them is still human at this point. Even if Palmer was the Thing, him leaving in the chopper and reporting Mac and Norris dead would not be a good move; it could easily be investigated. The second possibility is that neither Palmer nor Norris know that the other is a Thing, though this is highly contested. Just because Palmer and Norris were both revealed as Things later does not mean they were both Things at that given moment. We see Norris collapse later in the film. This is after Fuchs has informed us that a single cell of the Thing could (but not necessarily would) take over a whole person. Considering the manner of Norris' death, it could be suggested that he had been infected by a Thing (either through saliva from the dog, infected food, or whatever) and that at the crater Norris was still human, albeit, an infected human. Palmer, on the other hand, was almost assuredly a Thing by this point, though not brave enough to attempt to assimilate two people at once (which might have caused a crash and death for all). Interestingly, if Palmer was a Thing from the moment we see his shadow facing the dog, then later when we witness Childs and Palmer sharing a joint, it is conceivable that Childs became infected. Not that Childs becomes a Thing, as we witness in the blood test scene, but that he could have been well on his way to becoming a Thing."], ["What kind of form was the Thing when the Norwegians found it in that big block of ice?", "The shape and size of the block of ice is a deliberate ploy on the part of director, John Carpenter to reference the form of the alien in the other film version of the story, _The Thing_ (qv) from Another World. Carpenter persuaded the production designer to watch the earlier film and design the ice block accordingly. The block of ice was quite big with some type of weird outline carved in it, suggesting a large and relatively thin creature. The shape of the Thing is revealed in the prequel, _The Thing_ (qv) (2011). It is very dark-skinned, with large crab-like legs, talon-like digits and a large mouth with long sharp teeth; wide-shots of the burnt corpse of the creature make it look like that of a giant beetle. It is heavily implied that this is not the \"true\" shape of the Thing, but another assimilated creature from another planet and that what we see isn't even the form of the creature it assimilated as it could have altered its shape to suit its immediate need either before or while it was frozen. Note the similar Blair-Thing at the end, the Splitface-thing as it tries to kill someone in the prequel, and even the Norris spider-head, all of which show traits from the people they previously infected but change their shape to something that better suited their immediate need. So a Thing consists of billions of individual cells that can cooperate to form individual parts or entire organisms, choosing the shape of what it needs to be. For more information, get the DVD release of _The Thing_ (qv) and listen to the commentary by John Carpenter and 'Kurt Russell' (qv)."], ["Who got to the blood?", "One of the many questions and plot lines with no definite answers, though there is one explanation that seems more logical. Due to the tension of the scene of the men determining who got to the blood (Garry or Copper), all of them seem to have forgotten that Windows had the master keys last. In the scene when Windows gets the storage room keys from Garry and walks into the room to lock it up, we clearly hear him drop the keys when he runs out of the storage room after he discovers Bennings being assimilated. A few moments later, everyone except for Blair and Clark are outside huddled around the Bennings-Thing right before MacReady burns it. Just prior to being told about Bennings by Windows, Fuchs tells MacReady that Blair has locked himself in his room. This would have been a perfect opportunity for Blair to sneak out of his room, get the keys lying on the storage room floor, open the freezer locker in the storage room, and tamper with the blood by slicing the bags with a knife or razor (or even just the sharp end of the keys) before going out to kill the sled dogs, as well as destroy with the tractor and helicopter. However, we never see Garry or Windows recovering the keys at all before Garry is seen the next morning giving the master keys to Copper to use to go open the freezer locker.\n\nWhen stored, blood plasma is nearly frozen, and would take several hours for it to thaw out and run the way it did when we first see the fridge locker several hours later in the morning with a trail of blood seeping from it when Copper arrives to open it. Therefore, the blood must have been tampered with quite a while ago which would point to the previous evening or night... more evidence that it could have been Blair. Other evidence pointing to Blair is that he is a biologist, he would understand that the blood could be used as a test to expose him as a Thing (if he was infected at the time), or if he was not infected at the time, he could have realized the possibility that the blood could be used as a means to infect the other men of the camp, as a part of his theory that one cell could take over an organism, and eventually the world. Of course you can't discount the possibility that it was either Norris or Palmer.\n\nThe possibility of Norris or Palmer tampering with the blood isn't so far-fetched. If someone needs to simply request the keys from Garry, it's possibly either Norris or Palmer (now infected) asked for the keys for something trivial before anyone even knew the dog was a thing although it likely that Garry would have remembered. There are several keys on Garry's clip & anyone could have asked for them citing another purpose: gathering supplies from a locked room, fuel for the helicopter, etc. Garry could have handed over the keys, either to Norris or Palmer, who would open the fridge, tamper with the blood, lock it back up, hand the keys back to Garry and go on about their business. Unless someone was seriously injured, Copper likely wouldn't be going to check on the blood very often. So a lot of time could have passed from the time the blood was tampered with to the time it was discovered. (Also, if one takes the prequel into account, the Norwegian camp also came up with a similar blood test that was destroyed before it could be administered. _The Thing_ (qv) would have carried that knowledge from that camp to the U.S. camp and decided to ruin that test as quickly as possible)"], ["Why does Norris have a heart attack if he is the Thing?", "In the television version of the Thing, an additional voice over at the beginning of the film states Norris has a heart condition and his character notes in the screenplay by Bill Lancaster mention it.. Sometime after being assimilated by the Thing, we see Norris grimacing with pain while he is taking off the flamethrower on his back before helping the other men board up the outside doors and windows during a moment of stress. A few minutes later, when Norris sees Nauls returning alone from MacReady's shack, he clearly grabs his chest and sweating, as if in great pain before the others run in. Another minute later, while struggling with MacReady, he is thrown to the floor, passes out, and is rushed to the medical room where Copper attempts to revive him, first with CPR, then with the defibrillator. On the 2nd application of the defibrillator, the Norris-Thing reveals itself, biting off Copper's arms. There are two possibilities as to why the Norris-Thing had a heart attack: (1) It was a ploy by the Norris-Thing to get away from the men, faking death with the intention of either escaping or simply waiting for an opportunity to assimilate a lone individual, or (2) when the Thing assimilates a life form, it takes on an exact replica, including diseases and other characteristics. Thus, the Thing was unable to sustain its existence as Norris-Thing because the Norris model's heart had failed.\n\nIn regards to Theory 1, the Burned Corpse-Thing brought back from the Norwegian camp uses a similar ploy, faking death until it has the opportunity to attack an isolated Bennings. What the Thing may not have counted on was the application of electricity from the defibrillator, which it likely perceived as an attack and prompted its attack on Copper. In regards to Theory 2, the Thing is never shown to have the ability to shape-shift from one person to another, or one creature to another. When the Thing assimilates the dog at the Norwegian camp, it stays in this form until it turns into the amorphous shape it uses for attacking. Since the Thing does not appear to be capable of transforming its shape without directly assimilating another life form, it can be suggested that the Thing is only capable of replicating life forms with which it is in immediate contact. In this theory, the Thing is only able to exactly replicate what it immediately finds. In Norris' case, the Thing replicates Norris exactly, including his heart condition."], ["Why does MacReady shoot Clark?", "Whilst Norris was being treated in the infirmary, Clark grabs a scalpel off a table and hides it. In the next scene when MacReady wants to tie everybody down in order to do the blood test, Clark moves closer to Mac, pretending to support him in his idea. When Mac is arguing with Childs, Clark pulls out the scalpel and charges at Mac. So Mac turns and shoots Clark in the head. The shots of the scalpel are done in the foreground while something relatively important is happening in the background so lots of viewers miss Clark holding the scalpel. Lots of viewers thought Clark was just going to punch Mac, making Mac shooting him a bit extreme. Clark hiding the scalpel in his hand is much more clearly seen in the widescreen versions of the movie. The pan and scan versions omit Clark's hand holding the scalpel which would otherwise be on the far left of the screen. Also, at this point it was everyone against Mac. Everyone thought Mac was infected, so for Mac it was kill or be killed. Even if Clark had just intended to tackle MacReady, shooting him would have been Mac's only option. If Mac had simply tried to fight Clark, the rest of the team probably would of joined in and fought Mac, over-powering him. However, because Mac was willing to shoot Clark, it showed the rest of the team that he wasn't afraid to kill someone who made an attempt on him. Which is why as soon as Mac shoots Clark, we cut to everyone else already tied up. After Mac administers the test to Clark's blood & he's ruled out as assimilated, Childs calls Mac a murderer. However, Mac was also acting in self-defense."], ["If Palmer is the Thing, why did he draw attention to the Norris spider-head?", "Probably because such exposure would make Palmer look more human and help him gain a little more trust. Palmer only speaks out when Windows has also seen the spider-head. Palmer-Thing might normally have been willing to let the head escape but, once it had been seen by a human, its survival was compromised anyway. Hence Palmer-Thing could as well take the opportunity to make an exclamation (acting like a \"surprised human\"), thus diverting suspicion from himself. Whatever the reason, it is clear in the movie that Thing imitations (clones) do not necessarily look out for other Thing imitations, and they are described in the short story as being \"selfish\". Mac himself says that they would crawl away from a hot needle to save itself. It is also possible that Palmer was still self-conscious and, thus, would react normally and bring attention to the Norris spider-head."], ["When was Blair assimilated?", "One of the biggest questions of the film that is never fully explained. We will first break down the sequence of events and then explain the motives behind each from a human and Thing perspective. Sequence of events: (1) Blair runs the computer program and discovers the possible threat the Thing poses, (2) Blair kills all the sled dogs and destroys the tractor (off-camera), (3) Blair destroys the helicopter, (4) Blair injures Windows and destroys the radio, (5) Blair is locked up outside in the shed, (6) Mac is questioning Blair in the shed as to the whereabouts of Fuchs, and (7) Blair has clearly been assimilated: he is building a ship, attacks Garry, etc.\n\nNow, the question is asked, why would a human Blair kill the dogs and destroy everything? At this point, it is very clear that Blair understands the situation and feels that his comrades do not. He is afraid that the Thing will escape and infect the entire planet. He kills the dogs, destroys the helicopter, and destroys the tractor to isolate the men. Although Blair says, \"no dog can make it a thousand miles to the coast,\" he was more or less referring to a dog on its own, and not a team with a master. He may have also killed the dogs to prevent infection when we see Clark at the dog kennel sorrowfully looking at a dead dog with a fire axe in it's neck, though we know that an axe would not be sufficient enough to prevent that - keep in mind that Blair has lost his sanity at this point. Blair destroys the radio so that no outside help can be reached; it could be another way out. If this was the case (that Blair was assimilated after his lock-up), it was either Palmer or Norris that got to him while he was locked up in the tool shed. Somewhere during the 48-hour period that Mac refers to on his tape recording would seem logical.\n\n_The Thing_ (qv) perspective: The Blair-thing would have destroyed the tractor, radio, and helicopter to prevent the men from escaping and to keep them from reaching outside help. The dogs were killed to make his motives seem more human. The Blair-thing's plan worked; he was seeking isolation so that he could build a craft to escape. This makes it look as though the Thing's intentions are not to assimilate the entire Earth, but to simply get off the planet; had the Thing wanted to assimilate the entire planet, it could have just as easily stolen the helicopter as Palmer and fly to the nearest base, country, whatever but this assumes that the thing would only be able to pilot a helicopter as Palmer but this does not seem likely as it is building some kind of craft as Blair/thing.\n\nJust before being locked up, Blair tells Mac to watch out for Clark. Again there are two plausible possibilities as to what he meant, depending on whether he was infected yet. If Blair was still human, then it would have likely been that since he knew how the Thing worked, he deduced that since Clark had been isolated with the Dog-Thing for a long period of time, there was a very strong chance Clark was infected. If Blair was a Thing, then he would have been trying to throw Mac off, drawing suspicion towards a man who was still human whilst the Thing continues to infect the team.\n\nAnother possible, but remote, theory is that Blair was infected during the autopsy of the Burned Corpse-Thing or the remains of the Dog-Thing. It was a cellular infection which took some time to gain control of his body and \"conscious\" mind. _The Thing_ (qv) gained more control as the cellular infection increased over days. We know this is a considered by Blair. As the infected individual's body is slowly taken over, they remain conscious during this state but unaware that they are infected, but their actions are subtly influenced by the Thing's ever-increasing hold over them. Blair destroyed the dogs, tractor and chopper. The dogs being killed was a completely human response backed by his scientific knowledge that any one of the dogs could have been inadvertently infected during their attack in the kennel cage by hostile or cellular infection. In his destruction of the tractor and chopper, the Thing influenced his decisions.\n\nThink about it... _The Thing_ (qv) was a masterful strategist. It had been alive for eons and assimilated hundreds, maybe even thousands of beings and intellects, a theory referred to by Fuchs when he has his private conversation with Mac about Blair's notes. Many of its actions had a two-fold and even three-fold win-win situation that still gave it an edge in the final game. Yes... Blair destroyed the tractor and chopper to prevent the infection from spreading to populated areas (human response), but he also destroyed them to hide the fact that he had stolen parts from both. The crew was less likely to investigate a smashed, ripped-apart tractor or chopper to see that all of the parts were there. Blair was well aware of military protocol and knew that his mental breakdown would call for them to isolate him, giving him time to assemble the parts and build a craft to get him to the nearest populated area. The craft was never meant for long distance travel. A third goal in destroying the tractor, chopper and communications was to prevent anyone from getting out until they were ALL infected. Military protocol would have been to capture and quarantine all parties involved until it was determined who was human and who was not. _The Thing_ (qv) could not take the chance of someone contacting the rescue team and revealing the alien infection. However, Blair was not the only one who may have been infected by cellular means during the autopsy... Fuchs may have also been infected!\n\nWe see Blair performing the autopsy and Fuchs \"sniffing\" and going through the clothes of the Burned Corpse-Thing and other items there. Those garments and items are soiled with possible dried blood and other body fluids. Fuchs is seen standing there listening to Blair while going through the items without gloves or other personal protective equipment. Since the scene ends this way we can assume that Fuchs assisted Blair in other ways during this autopsy even if it was just \"Hold this\" or \"Move that.\" Cellular infection is HIGHLY probable at this point. This theory would also explain Fuchs' disappearance. By the time he talked to Mac, he knew that cellular infection was a strong possibility. Blair at this point was isolated and locked up (or so we thought), but Blair was secretly moving about the camp collecting and assembling the last of the parts and tools he needed to finish his craft. It is very possible that it was Blair who killed the power and walked past Fuchs' door in the dark. By the time Fuchs got outside to chase this suspicious person, he found Mac's undergarments.\n\nIf cellular infection was possible, by this time Fuchs' actions would be influenced subconsciously as well, since he was infected during the same time period as Blair. Thus, after finding Mac's undergarments, Fuchs heads to Mac's shack, possibly planning to snoop around for more proof that Mac was infected before accusing him publicly (clearly a human response). While there, he stuffed Mac's shorts in the oil furnace, this being a subconscious influence by the thing to keep an ally hidden. In all likelihood, Fuchs began to question his own actions on the walk back to the main compound and came to the realization that he \"must\" be infected to have just done such a strange thing rather than exposing Mac. _The Thing_ (qv) only attacks when discovered or \"attacked.\" Why wouldn't a self-realization spark an attack as well? At this point during Fuchs self-realization, the thing begins to reveal itself, going for a more quickened \"hostile takeover\" of Fuchs rather than the cellular option. As Fuchs begins to change and lose the last of his humanity, he does the only thing he can, setting himself on fire in the snow.\n\nAnother hint that Blair has been infected before he destroys the radio and communications equipment is that his intentions, as 'the thing', are to destroy any means of communication (radios) that will allow the remaining humans of the research outpost to contact the outside world and warn them of 'the thing' that they unleashed from the ice. Blair, as 'the thing', could prevent the humans from warning the rest of the world to either proceed with caution when approaching the arctic facility, or to isolate or even destroy the facility from afar. Once Blair, as 'the thing' was completely sure that the existence of the creature was safe and only known to the remaining humans in the facility, 'the thing' could take as much time as it needed to slowly and surely assimilate the rest of the crew.\n\nWhile Blair may have been infected on a cellular level when he autopsied the first remains of the thing early on in the film, it was slowly infiltrating his entire body, copying him slowly, to the point that Blair might have realized what was going on, causing his intense paranoia, enough to where he breaks down completely and attempts to kill everyone and destroy the communication equipment.\n\nThe theory of cellular assimilation is possibly debunked by what happens to Bennings. The dog runs up to him and licks him, in theory this would be enough to begin cellular transformation yet he is the first on screen aggressive assimilation we see. If he was already being infected on a cellular level which is easier to hide why would this be necessary?\n\nA sign that Blair was himself when he was first quarantined in the outdoor shed by the others was that when MacReady and the others talk to him from outside the shed door to ask the whereabouts of Fuchs, we see that Blair had hung a noose from the ceiling, possibly in an attempt to hang himself before the thing had time to take over. Perhaps he realized that his remains would still have cellular activity and he figured suicide was pointless. Perhaps he just couldn't bring himself to do it. Or perhaps he made the noose intending suicide, then his mind was finally assimilated and the thing stopped him from taking his own life. It's also worth noting that in the same scene, Blair tries to talk Mac into letting him back into the main camp. The Blair-Thing was clearly taking advantage of its isolation, so it seems strange that it would run the risk of joining back up with the rest of the men, since he would not be able to continue working on his craft without drawing suspicion. Thus it would be logical to say that Blair was human (or at least in the process of being assimilated) at this point; he really did feel bad about his actions and want to leave the shack.\n\nBut the other alternative is that the noose was a ruse. If Blair was a thing at that point, he would want to give the appearance of being normal, while still remaining isolated. A human Blair would, naturally, want to come back inside. But he would have to come up with a way to prevent that, without looking suspicious so he could keep working on the underground spaceship. If you were human, and trying to plead your case that you're recovered, would you leave something as obvious as a noose hanging over your shoulder? It has the same effect as saying you're sane while eating a bug.\n\nIt's entirely plausible that Blair rigged the noose as an insurance policy on the off-chance that the men would decide on their own to let him back in, or talk to him at some point. He begs to be let back in, but anyone talking to him would be able to see the noose hanging behind him, and would then assume that he's still not all there. MacReady certainly notices it, as after Blair's normal conversation and outward appearance of being back to normal, his only reply to Blair about being allowed back into the outpost is a rather non-committal, \"We'll see\", followed by cutting him off mid-sentence as he further pleads to be let back inside.\n\nOne theory that Blair has been infected early on is that he deliberately gets himself isolated by acting insane and out of control. Once he's alone in the cabin, outside of the surveillance of the other remaining crew members, he can begin digging the tunnel under the shed and building his ship that will allow him to escape to the mainland, or possibly even to outer space.\n\nIn the original story, \"Who Goes There?\" on which this movie is based, the character or Blair has a nervous breakdown and they isolate him in solitary confinement in a cabin. Like the movie, the short story never states when exactly Blair was assimilated, but it is possible that he was assimilated beforehand and fakes the nervous breakdown. In the cabin, the Thing, in Blair's body, begins building an anti-gravity device to get back into space, or to leave Antarctica, but before it can complete it, the other crew members realize what is happening and they kill the Blair-Thing before it could complete its objective.\n\nCarpenter and Producer Stuart Cohen have indicated that their plan was for Blair to have been infected at a very early time, as he is in Campbell's short story. Cohen goes on to indicate that MacReady's line upon the discovery of the spaceship, \"Blair's been busy out here all by himself\" is to indicate that Blair was a thing for quite awhile, long enough to have adequate time to build the spacecraft.\n\nIt's also worth noting that between the scene where he runs the computer simulation, and the time we see him again destroying the radio room, the yellow button-down shirt he was wearing has disappeared. The theory is that the thing rips through your clothes when it takes you over, so the disappearance of the shirt between the two appearances could definitely be because the shirt was destroyed in the take-over. We certainly see that the take-over destroys clothing, as Windows sees Bennings' destroyed shirt and vest in the storeroom after seeing Bennings in mid transformation.\n\nFuchs tells MacReady in the Thiokol Snowcat that Blair \"Locked himself in his room and won't answer the door.\" The assumption is that he's despondent after running the simulation, or is prepping for what he's about to do, but it's also possible that after running the simulation and taking the gun, he was surprised by Norris or Palmer and assimilated during that time. As we see when Blair attacks Garry, all Norris or Palmer would have to do is be standing outside Blair's door and put their hand over Blair's mouth to prevent a scream, and the assimilation would already be happening. Then they would just lead Blair back inside and lock the door behind them. That would explain why Blair loses the shirt he's been wearing all along prior to the radio room rampage."], ["What was the Blair-Thing's homemade craft to be used for?", "This question is not directly answered by the film. _The Thing_ (qv) does not necessarily have to go to a heavily populated area immediately, but find a means to escape the camp where its presence is known and being opposed. Ultimately, it must find other life forms to assimilate. This leads to a few possiblities. (1) The craft was to be used by the Thing to travel to another base in Antarctica or another country where it would have more life forms to replicate, or (2) _The Thing_ (qv) was building a craft to travel into space away from Earth (the less likely explanation). Considering how small the craft being built was in comparison to the original crashed spacecraft, it is highly unlikely the Thing would be able to build a suitable craft from spare parts capable of traveling to somewhere else in the galaxy with known life forms. (3) _The Thing_ (qv) was building the craft as a means of transport to get it to the crashed spaceship in the hopes of repairing it and flying it somewhere else, a theory given credence by the 2011 film where an infected human also makes his way back to it. Since, unlike the prequel film, Blair had destroyed most of the vehicles (apart from one or two small tractors that may not have been capable of travelling far), it had to make due with what it had, and so used the parts it could salvage (and possibly knowledge from prior victims) to improvise a simple vehicle that would do until he could get access to the more sophisticated flying saucer.\n\nAlthough the craft being built does resemble a flying saucer, it is unclear if the craft was intended to fly or travel on land (such as a snow mobile or hovercraft). Obviously, the craft would have to travel some distance before reaching the ocean, which would have to be traversed in order to reach another country. If the craft was capable of flight, the Thing could feasibly fly to another country. If the craft was intended to travel on land, then its purpose would be to find another base with humans, or a population of life forms, such as penguins, fish or birds. Of course, a hovercraft would be capable of both land and water travel. After replicating a penguin, fish or bird, the Thing could then just swim or fly to another country as that life form. It seems much more likely the Thing would attempt to assimilate as many life forms in Antarctica and use those to spread to other areas, rather than attempting to immediately travel to the nearest large landmass, most likely South America. In the original story that this film was based on, the thing in Blair's body nearly finished building an anti-gravity device in a shack in which it has isolated itself. The device would let it return to space using atomic power, but the remaining crew end up killing the thing before it can use the device to return to space or possibly fly to another heavily-populated area on Earth."], ["Does the Thing completely take over life forms or hide within them?", "From what we see in the movie, there seem to be two general ways in which a Thing can imitate another being. The most \"spectacular\" one is where the Thing uses its tendrils to absorb its prey, while its body functions as some sort of womb where a copy of the absorbed prey is created. We see this occurring with the dogs, and also with Bennings' assimilation. When Blair is conducting the autopsy on the burned corpse of what remains of the Dog-Thing he cuts out the half-formed replica of a dog. _The Thing_ (qv) essentially makes an extra \"copy\" from its prey. Each \"copy\" of the Thing (or \"imitations\" as they are called in the film) is basically an exact \"clone\" of the Thing in the form of the person or animal it kills. The other way is where the Thing infects another being with its cells, and the host is being taken over. This last process is most interesting, as it is never explained whether (1) people or animals that have become Things immediately die in the process of being assimilated by the Thing which then mimics its victims voice, actions, and feelings, (2) the victims regain consciousness after assimilation and essentially host the Thing clone apparently unaware that they have been assimilated, until the Thing decides to take over the host's actions, or (3) the victims retain consciousness while being assimilated from within. Several of these mechanisms seem possible, depending on how assimilation occurs, as evidenced in the movie.\n\nIn the film, evidence is pretty strong in regards to the first theory. It is stated that the Thing, even smaller parts of it (such as blood or Norris spider head), have an interest in self-preservation. This suggests that any actions taken by an infected life form, such as the dog fleeing the Norwegian camp or the Thing planting evidence to frame MacReady, are deliberate actions by the Thing to preserve itself. _The Thing_ (qv) perfectly mimics its victim and waits until it has the best opportunity to attack another life form or simply has no choice. The Dog-Thing does not attack at the camp until it is isolated with the other dogs, all of which are snarling and presumably about to attack the Dog-Thing (dogs have a highly developed sense of smell, and they might have smelled that this Dog-Thing is no real dog). The Norris-Thing does not reveal itself until it is on the table with the defibrillator being applied to its chest. The electric shock of the defibrillator may have been seen as an attack by the Thing. The Palmer-Thing does not reveal itself until the moment when MacReady tests its blood with the hot wire, attacking because it knows it will soon be burned otherwise. The Blair-Thing likewise avoids the other men until it is confronted in the bunker. All situations suggest the possibility that the Thing has entirely assimilated life forms and is imitating them until forced to reveal itself. The computer simulation created by Blair suggests the Thing can replicate by attacking, consuming and replicating cells, presumably using the DNA and material from the attacked life form to reform itself and thus make multiple imitations (clones) of itself.\n\nHowever, in an interview on the Thing DVD special features, 'Charles Hallahan' (qv) (Norris) points to the scene in which the men appoint MacReady as leader of the group following Windows' attempt to retrieve a shotgun from storage. Norris, who is presumably the Thing at this point, is originally offered the role of leader by Garry but declines stating that he doesn't believe he is up for it. Hallahan states that he always believed Norris knew at this point something was wrong with him and refused the offer because of the slight feeling that he may be the Thing, which directly supports the (2) theory. Norris later has a heart attack, which could be seen as an element of the real Norris and his heart condition or it could have been a ploy by the Norris-Thing to attempt to gain isolation from the group. It should be noted though that one of the co-producers of the film, Stuart Cohen, expressed surprise at Hallahan for this theory and said it had never been discussed. Therefore it can be assumed that this was only Hallahan's thinking and does not chime with the intentions of the film makers themselves. Of course, it is also possible that _The Thing_ (qv) was acting as Norris would in an attempt to remain hidden as long as possible and that Norris would have turned down the offer of the gun if he hadn't already been assimilated.\n\nAccording to the third theory, it is possible that, if an organism is infected with cells of a Thing, it would be conscious while it is being assimilated from the inside. This theory implies that assimilation normally occurs through infection with a few cells that slowly start to multiply and assimilate the host cells inside. This would explain how Blair (and possibly Fuchs) got infected during the alien autopsy. If Norris was also infected this way, then his actions (i.e: refusing a leadership position) are explainable. If this theory is correct, then assimilation would normally be a slow process; the host could become aware of his infection and attempt to take action against the Thing, possibly making his condition known in order to be destroyed along with the Thing. There is a possibility that Fuchs noticed he was being taken over and, therefore, killed himself. Alternatively, if assimilation needs to proceed quicker, then the Thing simply attacks its victim to cause more infections. This means that the host's cells are taken over much faster, and assimilation occurs almost immediately (as per theory 1). This may be what we see during the assimilation of Windows by Palmer-Thing; as he is bitten and is almost instantly taken over.\n\nRegardless of theory, it is clear that the Thing becomes capable of controlling the assimilation or host, retains their memories and skills, and uses them in whatever way possible to its advantage."], ["Why didn't the Dog-Thing assimilate Clark when it had plenty of opportunities to do so?", "The best explanation is that it was far too early; the Norwegian threat (for the Thing) had been eliminated, and it was safe for now. It probably wanted to scope out the entire camp before going after anyone; look for isolated parts of the camp that would be good to assimilate other victims. _The Thing_ (qv) may have also considered that, in the event it was discovered, Clark would be a liability because of his seclusion with the dog. In an interview on the Thing DVD, 'Richard Masur' (qv) calls Clark the red herring in the script. _The Thing_ (qv) is smart, almost as if it is playing chess with the men in the camp. It knows how to misdirect suspicion on the un-assimilated, to keep suspicion away from those who were assimilated. Therefore suspicion would definitely be on Clark because of his isolation with the dog, leaving it free to assimilate someone not suspected while all eyes were fixed on Clark. Also, the Thing may have simply been biding its time. It decided to stay hidden until it was alone with Palmer or Norris, and then again when locked in the cage with the other dogs. It waits for a few moments, thinking it's completely secluded and able to assimilate all the other dogs, then having significantly more numbers on its side. Unfortunately for the Thing, Clark heard the commotion as did MacReady, leading everyone in the camp to discover it."], ["Why was the creature found so close to the surface of the snow compared to the spaceship?", "This is not addressed in the film. In _The Thing_ (qv) (2011), the ship had made a long diagonal tunnel when crash-landing. Afterwards, the creature crawled out of ship and to the surface through that tunnel. At first, the ship was completely buried in ice; at the end of prequel, however, the creature returns to ship and activates its engines. The ice cave crumbles, and ship becomes visible from above, too, which explains the crater in 1982 movie. The video footage discovered in the 1982 movie briefly shows the Norwegians somehow clearing the ship with Thermite explosives, but they may have been widening the access tunnel or trying and failing to unearth the ship itself. On closer reflection, it should be obvious that the gargantuan crater where the ship rests could not have been dug out with thermite, unless the Norwegians had shipped truly enormous quantities of the explosive to the Antarctic for this very purpose (and such a large operation would already be internationally known). The prequel presented the more credible scenario that they only cleared a smaller access tunnel, and that the ship melted itself out of the ice when it was briefly activated."], ["Why did the other men extinguish the flames so quickly after Childs had torched the thing, in the scene when it first reveals itself in the dog-kennel?", "This could possibly be an error of continuity from a directing standpoint since it could have been several seconds rather then a few seconds between the shots. However, there are a few possible explanations. First, the men could really have had that much confidence that the Thing had been killed that quickly. Second, they had fear that the flames could catch other things on fire, such as the wooden planks on the ceiling of the dog kennel that the Thing grabs on to. This is supported by the scene later on where Mac burns the Norris-Thing creature in the MedLab, the others immediately run and grab extinguishers but Mac tells them to wait until the burning Norris-Thing stops moving. About 10 seconds later, the men again ask Mac to let them put out the fire and he screams at them: \"JUST WAIT!\" as Mac figured out that it takes a lot of fire to kill the things and just setting them on fire and then extinguishing the flames right away does nothing. Third, they might have acted on instinct. Another aspect is that, in the conditions of the Antarctic weather, fire is the greatest hazard to life as shown by the final scenes. In this situation a fire that could potentially destroy the base would have been perceived as the greatest danger facing them before the reality of the Thing had been appreciated."], ["Why do they call him \"Windows\"?", "The most logical suggestion is that it's a nickname given to him because he constantly wears sunglasses, inside or out, day or night. Others have suggested that, as the radio operator, Windows was their main \"window to the world\", a saying from early in the days of radio. In the Alan Dean Foster novelization the character is called Sanders. In an early version of the script by Bill Lancaster the radio operator is called Sanchez."], ["Is _The Thing_ (qv) male, female, both, neither?", "_The Thing_ (qv) may most accurately be regarded as \"asexual\". It is neither male nor female as it does not procreate by having sex but rather consuming living cells and replicating them."], ["Who did Childs see outside?", "Childs claims to have seen Blair outside. It seemed like a rational statement, as he knew for sure there were only three other people still alive and one person who they were not certain about. Since the other three survivors had left in a group, the one isolated individual walking away might have been the Blair-Thing, having escaped from the shack. Also, moments after the group see Childs run out of the base, the power goes out, suggesting Childs did see Blair. Of course, all of the survivors were both under a lot of stress as well as exhausted and sleep-deprived, which would have made it harder for them to think clearly, so it possible that Childs was hallucinating or that his mind was otherwise playing tricks on him. It's interesting to note; when the group goes to give Blair the test, there is a long ominous shot of the facility. The camera pans into the coat room where Childs was guarding, Childs is gone, the door has been left open and snow had begun to build up at the entrance. Moments later, Nauls sees Childs run outside. It's possible Childs was attacked and assimilated, and we see the now-infected Childs run off into the storm. It's also possible that Childs was searching all around the facility for Blair and we simply see him running through a corridor."], ["What happened to Fuchs?", "As with pretty much every other question, we don't know. In his final scenes, Fuchs chases a shadow when the lights in the lab blow out and he runs outside where he discovers a torn piece of clothing on the ground with MacReady's name sewn on it. Later, MacReady, Windows, and Nauls find his body in the snow where he is dead and his body is burned to a crisp. Whether or not he burned himself or the Thing burned him is hard to say. It is possible that he burns himself upon learning that MacReady could be a Thing after discovering the ripped jacket. He could have burned himself if the Thing had come to attack him. _The Thing_ (qv) could have burned him just as a way of getting rid of him. After discovering Fuchs' dead body, MacReady and Nauls head up to MacReady's shack to look around when they see the lights on inside after MacReady had claimed to have turned them off when he left the shack a day ago. Nauls returns alone claiming to have found a torn jacket with MacReady's named on it stuffed in MacReady's oil furnace in the shack (the same torn piece of clothing that Fuchs found on the ground just before his death).\n\nPossibilities include:\n\n(1): Fuchs burned himself after discovering MacReady may be infected. Fuchs may have done this out of fear and confusion. Perhaps the Thing was setting him up as the person who was supposed to expose MacReady. If Fuchs had burned himself, it would explain why the Thing had to re-plant the evidence (the torn piece of clothing with MacReady's name stamped on it) in Mac's shack.\n\n(2): Fuchs killed himself by setting himself on fire with the lighted flare he had after a near-attack from the Thing who either followed him outside or was already outside waiting for him. _The Thing_ (qv) may have tried to attack Fuchs, and in response Fuchs killed himself to prevent that from happening. This would also explain the evidence being re-planted. An intriguing variation on this theory is that Fuchs realized he himself was being taken over. It's been shown earlier that when a Thing is discovered, it will reveal itself and try to take action, so why would a self-realization not trigger the same reaction. The logic here is that Fuchs somehow realized he had been taken over or at least deduced some reason why there was a good chance of him being taken over. Then either the part of him already assimilated opted to change tactics to \"hostile takeover\" (similar to what happened to Bennings) or he simply decided to keep the process from being completed - either way, he stopped it the only way he could, by lighting himself on fire.\n\n(3): Fuchs was murdered. _The Thing_ (qv) may have killed Fuchs to make sure that there were no scientific minds capable of forming a test - Blair was locked up and Copper had been drugged. It would have been easy to do; Fuchs was holding a lit flare, so dousing him in fuel would have probably done it. But '3' leads to another unanswered question; why not assimilate him? Fuchs was gone for an extended period of time, and it would have made the men very suspicious. It is important to note that a scene, though never released, details Fuchs as being impaled by a shovel, which would suggest one of the Things killed him. Can be found here. Another possibility is that Norris and Palmer (who were later revealed to be the Things) are seen with flamethrowers. It is possible that one of them got a hold of Mac's jacket and after ripping it he planned on placing it somewhere to frame Mac. But after Fuchs saw him (his shadow), he quickly threw Mac's jacket on the snow, maybe to lure Fuchs out on the open so he could have better shot at killing him with flamethrower.\n\n(4): Fuchs accidentally burned himself to death while attempting to fight a Thing.\n\n(5) Fuchs deliberately killed himself before he could be assimilated as a Thing."], ["Why was Outpost 31 equipped with flamethrowers?", "The most logical answer is that they were to be used to quickly melt ice if the need arose. This is presumably the reason the Norwegian base also had flamethrowers in the prequel."], ["What was the purpose of having dogs in the base?", "They were presumably intended in case the need arose to use a dog sled. This is a perfectly common means of transportation in snow-covered areas (particularily the Antarctic), and it would be useful if the snow-cats or the helicopter were to break down."], ["Were there any Things not destroyed in this film?", "There is only one Thing that is never fully accounted for. During the blood test, Mac places a needle in Palmer's blood, causing a Thing to jump out of the tray. However, this particular Thing is never destroyed as the men are distracted by the Palmer-Thing revealing itself. The Palmer's Blood-Thing probably attempted to remain hidden. Also, we did see that the Burned Corpse-Thing did have enough cellular activity left to infect Bennings, and so it's not impossible that a small piece of it broke off and hid for its own survival. In fact, given that \"Splitface\" survived being burned alive, it's not impossible that some cellular activity is still left in the remains of the Bennings-Thing or Fuchs (assuming he was infected before being burned). However, it is equally possible that any of the aforementioned Things were destroyed when the base was. Also, if the blood creature wasn't destroyed when the base was, it would likely freeze very quickly. We know the Thing can survive being frozen, and a small puddle of blood would likely go undiscovered. (It was however too small to be intelligent, reacting on instinct only; this is why the blood test could expose it in the first place.)\n\nIt is also unknown if the frozen suicide victim in the Norwegian camp was infected or if any other thing samples of remnants were left in labs or frozen in the surrounding area. A deleted scene in the 2011 prequel shows this man killing himself to avoid assimilation; the particular Thing he feared was a smaller, scuttling organism that is never accounted for. It never appeared when Mac visited the ruined Norwegian camp, perhaps suggesting that it had frozen by then (but it would be very much viable if ever thawed). Then there is the spaceship itself, which may have numerous thing corpses or samples aboard."], ["How long a period of time does _The Thing_ (qv) take place over?", "The movie itself is somewhat vague on the exact timeframe, but it seems to take place roughly over the course of a few days, though exactly how many is unclear. Note that when Mac is recording his tape, he mentions that the storm has been hitting them for roughly 48 hours. The storm in question seems to start some time on the second night, meaning that by the time Mac made his recording, a period equivalent to three days must have passed (assuming his estimate was correct). This would mean that by the end of the movie at least four or five days have passed since the opening scene.\n\nChronologically, it goes something like this:\n\n-Day One: The opening scene of the film where Lars and Matias arrive at Outpost 31 (the same point at which the prequel left off). Mac and Copper go to investigate the Norwegian base and find the Burned Corpse-Thing, which Blair attempts to examine unsuccessfully. The Dog-Thing also reveals itself in the evening, and Blair performs a more successful autopsy.\n\n-Day Two: Mac, Norris, and Palmer investigate the crater, discovering the UFO. Fuchs starts to discover that something's going on when Blair refuses to leave his room. Bennings is suddenly infected, leading to the burning of Splitface and the remains of the Dog-Thing. Blair finally snaps, leading him to destroy everything, and is subsequently locked up in the tool shed.\n\n-Day Three: The men also discover that the blood samples have been tampered with, leaving Garry, Copper, and Clark as the primary suspects. Its about this point that Mac begins to take over. Also somewhere between Day Two and Day Three the snowstorm begins. Mac begins working with Fuchs to try and find an alternative test to figure out who is human and who is a Thing. Some time late at night, Fuchs mysteriously dissapears.\n\n-Day Four and/or Five: Mac records his tape (assuming his calculations are correct and the storm started late Day Two, this would have happened late on Day Five). A lengthy search finally reveals the burned corpse of Fuchs. Nauls finds Mac's torn clothes in his shack, leading him to become a prime suspect. Norris has a heart attack and kills Copper. Clark is shot. Mac figures out a blood test before deciding that the best course of action is to blow up the camp.\n\nFrom a filmmaking standpoint, the gradual confusion in how much time has passed (whether it was intentional or not) could be argued as a clever and subtle means of capturing how the characters (all exhausted, sleep-deprived, scared, and confused) feel in their situation."], ["Who was the mysterious shadowy figure?", "This is one of many things the film leaves ambiguous. Presumably the Dog-Thing infects whoever the shadow belonged to. Now in the film there are four people confirmed to be infected before the blood test. Bennings, Norris, Palmer and Blair. Bennings can be ruled out because he was found in the middle of his transformation. That leaves three possible candidates- Norris, Palmer or Blair. While both the film and the original short story Who Goes There?  were vague on when exactly Blair was infected, the shadow does not appear to match his appearance (note that the figure appears to be tall and thin, unlike Blair's large and somewhat obese structure) . Also, the shadow seems to have a full head of hair, whilst Blair has a receding hairline. Therefore, Blair can be ruled out as a suspect. Palmer would be the logical choice for assimilation because the Thing knows he is a helicopter pilot (the Dog-Thing has heard him volunteer to fly Copper to the Norwegian camp but Garry sends Mac instead) and is therefore best suited to help it escape. Also he is a fairly quiet, reclusive character who generally does not draw attention, making it easier for the Thing to work undetected. The scene was originally shot using 'David Clennon' (qv) but the shadow was thought too recognisable and was re-shot using a stunt actor named Dick Warlock, whose body structure was vaguely similar to that of 'David Clennon' (qv) (Palmer) and 'Charles Hallahan' (qv) (Norris)."], ["Why Did Fuchs choose to talk to Mac about Blair's notes on the Thing and not Garry?", "Fuchs just felt Mac was the one most likely to be trustworthy. From Blair's notes he knew the Thing could have taken over anyone, but deduced that Mac had not been infected and felt he could trust him, which is why they work so closely together afterwards. As paranoia sunk in, Fuchs even became suspicious/fearful of Mac, as evidenced by his tense reaction when Mac approached him in his lab. This could have also been the intention behind the Thing leaving MacReady's torn clothes for Fuchs to find- since he would think Mac was a Thing, therefore breaking his trust and leaving him with nobody else to go to- resulting either him panicking and accidentally lighting himself in the process or burning himself because he saw no other way to avoid being infected."], ["How does the movie end?", "While Childs keeps watch over the camp, Mac, Garry, and Nauls head out to the shed to give the blood test to Blair but discover the door open and Blair missing. They blow up the spaceship that Blair was making under the shed then set out to blow up the rest of the camp so that the Thing can't escape or resort to freezing itself again. As Garry attempts to plant dynamite in the storage room, Blair suddenly attacks and kills him. Mac and Nauls plant their dynamite in the generator room. Nauls wanders into another room and is not seen again. Suddenly, the floor boards are ripped up, and the Blair-Thing reaches through to get Mac. Mac tosses a lighted stick of dynamite at it, blowing up the Thing and the building. With the whole camp now in flames, Mac takes a seat outside. He is joined by Childs who has been out of sight for several minutes and claims that he went looking for Blair. In the final scene, they sit together, wary of each other, waiting for the fires to die down and the bitter cold Antarctic winter to overtake them."], ["Who is infected at the end?", "The mother of all questions. Answer: unknown. It is as reasonable to assume that Childs is the Thing as much as it is to assume he is human. There is certainly enough time for him to be assimilated, but he does have an alibi. He claims he saw Blair out in the snow, and since MacReady ordered him to kill Blair, if Blair came back without the others, he was merely following orders. It is not hard to believe Childs' explanation; Garry, Nauls, and Mac had been gone for a good amount of time during their visit to the tool shed to look for Blair, and all of the men were sleep-deprived. Had Childs been a Thing at the end, he could have easily torched Mac with the flamethrower that he was armed with.\n\nOne case that could be made towards Childs being human involves taking into account the information given in the prequel, where it is revealed that the Thing cannot replicate inorganic material (i.e. piercings, fillings, joint replacements). While this fact is never confirmed in the Carpenter film, there is no evidence denying it apart from the scene where Nauls is killed by a Box-Thing (which was never shot and is therefore not canon). If you look closely in the final scene, Childs has an earring. Taking this logic into account it would be almost definitive proof that he is still human, since if he were a Thing he would have spat out the earring. The only possible explanation for this is that the Thing learned from its previous experiences and so whenever possible would attempt to replace visible inorganic material such as earrings. However, if Childs was infected, and spat out the earring, it could easily have been lost depending on his location (if he were outside at the time, it could have gotten buried in the snow; if Blair had assimilated him inside the coat room, it could have rolled under something). It's also worth mentioning that the men at Outpost 31 were not aware of this fact, so they would not have questioned him suddenly removing it. Also the remaining men were sleep-deprived and probably not thinking clearly, so they probably wouldn't have noticed the missing earring anyway, let alone question it. Therefore, it seems strange that the Childs-Thing would get down on the ground and waste its time looking for an earring for three reasons:\n\n1) As mentioned previously, most likely nobody would have bothered questioning it, since much like how Kate never had any experiences that led her to realize the Thing's cells function independently, Mac never experienced anything leading him to conclude that the Thing could not replicate inorganic material.\n\n2) Getting down and searching for the earring would leave him vulnerable, as someone could theoretically sneak up on him and attack him while he is not looking. Also he would have a hard time explaining why he is searching so desperately when there are more pressing matters at hand.\n\n3) There was really no need to do a perfect impression of anyone anymore. By this point, Mac was the only other survivor, and he was incredibly weak, freezing to death, and unarmed ('Kurt Russell' (qv) said that he had a torch/flamethrower under his coat during that scene), meaning that Childs could have easily assimilated him, and Mac would be powerless to stop him. The fact that he doesn't would strongly suggest that he is still human.\n\nIf we wanted to make a case that Childs was the Thing, we could say that when Childs saw Blair out in the storm he was being lured into being assimilated. _The Thing_ (qv) got into the camp by getting Childs to open the door, and it got Childs in the process. It then kept Childs away from danger until the situation was over, like protecting the queen in a chess game. When Childs says, \"What will we do?\" Mac suggests they should maybe do nothing. The way Mac is watching and smiling at Childs suggests that Mac is almost certain Childs is the enemy and has won, but Mac accepts the defeat gracefully, and honorably, and even extends his bottle to Childs, so they can drink together. This could be seen as a big developmental leap for Mac, since the first opponent we saw him lose to was the chess computer, and he immaturely destroyed that opponent when he lost the game by pouring his drink into it and calling it a cheating bitch. Interestingly, in the novelization of the film by Alan Dean Foster, the book ends with Mac initiating a chess game with Childs.\n\nWas Mac infected? There are theories that he was, but the evidence points to 'no'. Mac passes the blood test, and the possibility of him rigging it and managing to cheat his way out are very slim. Also, had he been infected, he would have most likely only taken one man with him to Blair's shed. This way Mac would be able to assimilate another victim. It is also hard to believe that Mac would kill Blair had he been a Thing. Had MacReady been a Thing before the blood test, he could have killed the remaining humans. Instead of tying up Palmer, he could have had Palmer tie everyone down, and while Nauls, Garry, Childs, and Windows were strapped down, could have burned or assimilated all of them. The fact that he does not do this suggests strongly that he is human.\n\nAre both infected? Again, probably not. Some say the dialogue is awkward and cryptic, but there's no strong evidence whatsoever to assume this. The theory of Mac being infected because he gives Childs the bottle and then laughs is not strong; we never see the Thing employ the \"single-cell assimilation\" technique at all during the film, and we don't even know if it's possible. His actions are not strange; Mac had previously acknowledged that no one was going to survive. He says to Nauls and Garry \"We're not getting out of here alive, but neither is that Thing.\" Two comic book sequels were made in which Childs and Mac survive, pursued by the Thing. At the end of the second comic it is revealed that Childs is the creature. Whether or not these comics are canon is unclear. There is also a PS2 video game which carried on where the original film left off. In the initial scenes of the game Childs' body is found indicating that he was human. His cause of death is not made clear. At the end of the game the main character is rescued by a presumably human Mac flying yet another helicopter. Together they defeat a huge and grotesque incarnation of the Thing."], ["Is there an alternate ending?", "Yes, two alternate endings were shot, although only one has been seen. The first is a shot of the camp the next day, burned to the ground with billows of smoke rising into the air. In the distance we see a dog running away from the camp. The dog stops and turns, looks at the camp, then continues to run again. The second ending is mentioned on the DVD but has never been used. It showed MacReady in an office with evidence that he has just taken and passed a blood test. This sequence was shot for safety because of the downbeat ending, but was never shown to audiences, not even in test screenings."], ["What happened to the survivors?", "The fates of MacReady and Childs are intentionally left open for the viewer to speculate on. The most logical answer would be that they both froze to death, seeing as their only source of heat was their burning base, whose fires probably would have died out by the morning. It was already established that the rescue team wouldn't be able to make it, and MacReady seemed to be aware that this was going to happen towards the end. However, some have argued that one (or both) of the survivors are actually Things. Childs could have been infected while he was searching for Blair, though this raises the question of why he does not attack the isolated and defenseless MacReady.\n\nThere are two alternate endings of the film which hint towards two different fates of the characters. One had MacReady in an office some time later with evidence showing that he is still human, which would mean that he survived, although as the scene has never been shown, it is not known if it would have indicated Childs to have survived as well. The other alternate ending shows the camp burned, and a dog (presumably a Thing) escaping, and since it does not attack either of the two survivors, it would probably mean they had frozen to death during the night. John Carpenter mentioned that if he ever did a sequel, it would have MacReady and Childs being rescued by a team alerted via a transmission Windows was able to get out before Blair went crazy. He would blame the aging of 'Kurt Russell' (qv) and 'Keith David' (qv) on their characters' exposure to the elements. This would suggest that the man who made this film intended them to survive.\n\nA number of unofficial continuations exist which have suggested different fates of the characters. The video game, for example, implies Childs to have died but reveals that Mac survived. There is also a series of comics in which Mac and Childs are rescued but the latter is revealed to be a Thing. In the DVD commentary for the 2011 version of _The Thing_ (qv) the writers/directors/producers postulate that Kate, the sole survivor from the end of that film will make her way to the US base via a snowcat in pursuit of the dog and arrive in time to rescue MacReady and Childs. The 2011 film also establishes that knowledge of the spaceship's discovery has extended beyond Antarctica so it is possible others are on their way to investigate and may save them. Outpost 31, the official _The Thing_ (qv) fansite has a number of fan fiction stories which have tried to continue where the film left off. See here. The nature of the stories vary, and point towards different fates for the characters. The Tape reveals that Childs froze to death but leaves Mac's fate open. _The Thing_ (qv) EX: An Alternate Ending  reveals that Childs and Mac both froze to death (although a UFO is reported to have been found, suggesting one of them was infected). The Aftermath sees Mac and Childs return to the Norwegian base only for it to be revealed that Mac is a Thing and he's been infecting Childs through a bottle of whiskey. THE THING II: CONTAGION reveals that both Mac and Childs were rescued, but one of them is infected and accidently spreads through another base, and the story ends with the implication that Mac froze to death in the Antarctic Ocean. Unfinished Buisiness takes a slightly more optimistic approach, revealing Mac and Childs to be rescued by a Russian expedition team who saw the explosions; both are revealed to be human and spend most of the story working to figure out how to destroy the Thing once and for all."], ["What are the fates of the characters?", "R.J. MacReady: Survives the events of the film (though it is a possibility that he froze to death some time afterward).\n\nChilds: Survives the events of the film (though it has been argued that he was assimilated by the Blair-Thing, and it is possible that he froze to death as well).\n\nBlair: Seemingly goes crazy and cuts off the group from the outside world by destroying the snow-cats, the helicopter, the radio equipment, etc. He claims he did this so _The Thing_ (qv) couldn't be rescued and brought to civilization but it's also possible he was infected and did this so he could assimilate as many of the group as possible before their eventual rescue. The group lock him up in a tool shed away from them so he couldn't do any more damage. The survivors go back out to check on him and find that he had become or always was a Thing and had burrowed a small cave underneath the snow and had been building a small craft to escape the camp. The survivors track him down to the basement of the installation and rig the whole base to explode. MacReady kills the Blair-Thing with a stick of dynamite which also sets off the rest of the bombs destroying the majority of the installation.\n\nNauls: Heads to the basement to rig explosives with Mac and Garry. He wanders off alone to find a place to plant his explosives. He hears a strange noise and he isn't seen again but the Blair-Thing is seen attacking from the area in which Nauls had been, implying he was killed quick and quietly.\n\nGarry: Goes with Mac and Nauls into the basement to rig explosives. He is attacked by the Blair-Thing, who sticks its hand into Garry's face and bonds directly with his face and kills him. He is then dragged off camera and presumably consumed.\n\nWindows: When Palmer-Thing is discovered it escapes its restraints, fires a tentacle at Windows and pulls Windows' head into the thing's mouth and proceeds to attack him before Palmer-Thing throws him against a wall. Once Mac deals with the Palmer-Thing, he comes back inside to see Windows being infected and becoming a Thing. So Mac finishes him off with the flamethrower.\n\nPalmer: Discovered to be a Thing during Mac's blood test. He breaks free from his restraints and starts attacking Windows. Mac manages to burn the Palmer-Thing and finish him off with a stick of dynamite.\n\nClark: tries to stab Mac with a scalpel, but Mac shoots him in the forehead before he's able. Mac tests his blood even though he was dead and he was still human.\n\nNorris: After trying to subdue Mac, Norris has a heart attack and collapses. Copper shocks him with a defibrillator in order to try and resuscitate him to no avail. When Copper tries again, Norris' stomach rips open revealing him to be a Thing filled with Razor-sharp teeth and Copper's arms slip into the stomach-mouth and get bitten off. Mac burns Norris' body with a flamethrower. Norris' head detaches to try and escape but Palmer brings it to Mac's attention. So Mac finishes off the Norris-Head-Thing with the flamethrower.\n\nCopper: While trying to resuscitate Norris, his arms get bitten off by the Norris-Thing and he presumably dies from a combination of shock, loss of blood, and possibly also smoke inhalation (as everyone is trying to get away from the Norris-Thing, while Copper is still left lying nearby as there was no chance for anyone to get to him without being attacked combined with the fact that Mac let the Thing burn as long as possible). Mac tests Copper's blood regardless and it's revealed he was still human.\n\nFuchs: Arguably the most mysterious death in the film. Fuchs is in his lab when the power goes out. He sees someone walk by and follows them outside with a flare to light his way. He finds some shredded clothing that have MacReady's name on them. Mac, Nauls and Windows go outside and find the charred remains of a body they assume is Fuchs. They all speculate that he either burned himself before he could be assimilated, tried to burn a Thing and accidentally burned himself or the Thing burned him.\n\nBennings: The group store the presumed dead, Burnt Corpse-Thing (a.k.a. Splitface) that Mac and Copper found at the Norwegian base. Bennings goes into the storage room to get some of his things out, and Splitface attacks him while his guard is down. Windows goes back to witness the Thing assimilating Bennings. The rest of the group find the Bennings-Thing outside trying to escape. Mac dumps a drum of fuel onto the Bennings-Thing and lights him on fire with a flare."], ["Why do they have all these guns in Antarctica?", "Cold war paranoia, especially given that the prequel film establishes a Russian base to be located a few miles away despite going against the Antarctic treaty (which states guns aren't permitted in Antarctica) in event that they were to be attacked by Russians. Note the rifles Windows reaches for are locked in a cabinet that he has to break open, possibly due to the desire to save them for emergencies. As for Garry having the revolver; Garry is clearly the station manager and likely a sort of security guard as well. Being in the most hostile and isolated part of the world, it's possible for someone to have a mental breakdown and become dangerous, harming themselves or others (as Lars was initially believed to have done in the opening scene). Garry carries the sidearm likely as a precautionary measure in case any members of the research station try and attack one another, or as we saw at the beginning of the film, to defend the base against an attacking force. However, the novelization mentions that Garry also had some prior military experience- he mainly carries the sidearm around as much as he does out of habit more than anything else. Palmer even jokes about wondering when \"El Capitan was going to get a chance to use his pop gun\", possibly suggesting that Garry's constant holding of his gun has occasionally been the subject of ridicule."], ["What does the Thing actually want?", "Three main theories in this regard. The most commonly accepted theory, which is the one mainly suggested in the film itself, is that either by its inherent nature or conscious choice it wants to take over the world and transform all lifeforms, that in effect it is an invader/parasite. A different theory is that it is not actually hostile at all, it simply wants to survive and go home, which is given credence by Blair's construction of his improvised spaceship in his lair. A less common third theory is that the Thing is actually a form of scientific researcher and investigates new planets and lifeforms by assimilating a sample of them."], ["How does Mac know he'll need Childs with his flamethrower in order to kill the Dog-Thing?", "The base was only equipped with a few basic weapons. A handgun, a few shotguns and two or three flamethrowers. While the creature was attacking the dogs, Mac sends Bennings to get Childs and the flamethrower in case they'd need it. After they fired on it with the shotguns and handgun, seeing that it didn't do any damage, Mac orders Childs to torch it figuring it'd be the best bet. Mac also had seen evidence of the Norwegians using fire against the Thing. He had seen the \"Splitface\" corpse at the Norwegian camp, which had been burned with kerosene. The Norwegians who arrived at the camp earlier were attempting to use thermite grenades against the dog, and their helicopter was loaded with kerosene containers. These hints from the Norwegians probably led him to believe that fire would be a successful weapon against the Thing. He didn't just jump straight to 'flamethrower!' with no evidence."], ["Why is the spaceship uncovered here yet we see it still sealed in an ice cavern at the end of the 2011 film?", "Presumably the starting up of the spaceship's engines/grenade explosion weakened the roof of the ice cavern and it collapsed in between Kate leaving and MacCready, Norris and Palmer arriving.\nIf the finale of the 2011 film is observed closely, after the Thing has fired up the engines, the ceiling of the cavern fractures and begins to fall.\nThere is a panning shot from the ship to the now revealed starry night sky above, showing that the ship has, in fact, been completely uncovered before Mac, Norris and Palmer arrive."], ["What is _The Thing_ (qv)'s original form?", "_The Thing_ (qv) doesn't have an original form in the macro world. _The Thing_ (qv) is a single celled organism that works together with other single celled versions of itself to form different creatures. _The Thing_ (qv)'s original form is a single cell."], ["Would a person know if they're a Thing?", "When the Thing assimilates a person, that person dies. _The Thing_ (qv) is doing a perfect impression of you and hiding behind the mask of your face and tapping into your memories for useful behaviors to fool those around it.

It debuted at #8 at the U.S. box office. The movie's production budget was approximately $15M USD and although it grossed close to $20M domestically, the studio would not have made their total outlay back (due to marketing and distribution costs and the fact that theaters keep, on average, almost half of the box office for themselves). Despite not being a commercial success, John Carpenter has stated that of all the films he's directed, he's most proud of _The Thing_ (qv). In the DVD commentary, Carpenter and 'Kurt Russell' (qv) theorize some factors as to why the film didn't perform better at the box office; they believe the largest contributing factor is that E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial had been released two weeks earlier and was a major success. It had a PG rating, had a very light-hearted and optimistic view of alien visitation whereas _The Thing_ (qv) was the exact opposite. 'Kurt Russell' (qv) also suggested that the AIDS virus was just becoming a very public disease at the time and this movie deals with the idea of an organism infecting blood cells which may have been very off-putting to the audience. Lastly, critics were not kind to the film either. They praised the special effects, but blasted the actual film. However, over time, the film has become regarded as one of the greatest science-fiction movies of all time and has gained a large cult following."], ["Will there be a sequel?", "There is a prequel that was released on October 14th 2011 which chronicles the events at the Norwegian camp. The ending of the prequel is right when this film starts. There was also a video game released in 2002 which serves as a sequel to this film. It told the story of a special forces team sent in to investigate Outpost 31 and had some similarities to the \"Resident Evil\" storyline (a greedy corporation wanting to use the Thing as a bio-weapon). MacReady makes an appearence towards the end of the game. In addition there was also another sequel in the form a comic book series in the early 1991 called \"_The Thing_ (qv) From Another World\" by Dark Horse. This title was designed to distinguish it from the Marvel character, _The Thing_ (qv) (of Fantastic Four fame). This story followed on from the 1982 film and involved a Navy SEAL team rescuing MacReady who had managed to get seperated from Childs. One of the SEAL team is infected by a sea-lion before MacReady is brought back to a military base that he eventually escapes from. When Childs finally shows up he too is later infected. The comics ran for four series.\n\nThe Sci Fi Channel planned a 4 hour mini-series sequel in 2003. John Carpenter stated that he believed the project should proceed, but the Sci Fi Channel later removed all mention of the project from their homepage. In February 2009, a positive review of the abandoned screenplay for the Sci-Fi miniseries was published on Corona's Coming Attractions. In 2004, Carpenter said in an Empire magazine interview that he has a story idea for _The Thing_ (qv) II, which centers around the two surviving characters, MacReady and Childs. However, Carpenter felt that due to the higher price associated with his fee, Universal Studios will not pursue his storyline. Carpenter indicated that he would be able to secure both 'Kurt Russell' (qv) and 'Keith David' (qv) for the sequel. In his story, Carpenter would explain the age difference of the actors between the two installments by having frostbite on their face due to the elements until rescued. The assumption of the sequel would rely on a radio-signal being successfully transmitted by Windows before Blair destroyed the communications room. Thus, after the explosion of the base camp, the rescue team would arrive and find MacReady and Childs still alive."], ["What differences are there between the script and film", "Much of the film was simplified in order to make the budget stretch further.\n\n- Windows is called Sanchez\n\n- At the Norwegian Camp MacReady bumps into a human arm pinned by a closed shut door still gripping an extinguished welding torch, he opens the door and the severed arm drops to the ground.\n\n- Copper finds a tape recorder and plays it where he hears a Norwegian talking.\n\n- In the ice-block room, Macready opens a stuck metal cabinet which dislodges a frozen human body missing an arm.\n\n- The scene of them finding split-face outside is omitted.\n\n- When the Dog enters the 'Strangers room', he is heard struggling inside with it.\n\n- Childs 'shoos' off the dog as it wanders round camp from his greenhouse where he is watering his cannabis plants.\n\n- After checking out the Norwegian video, Copper plays the tape recorder he found with the Norwegian talking and in the background a Thing attack can be heard taking place.\n\n- The scene of them showing Split-face to the rest of the camp takes place further on in the film after Mac and Copper get back.\n\n- MacReady is seen inflating a blow-up sex doll in his cabin whilst he watches the Norwegian video tapes of them discovering the saucer and ice-block Thing.\n\n- The Dog Thing is not seen shedding it's skin, instead the dogs all pounce on the imitation dog cutting to the next scene.\n\n- MacReady hears Dogtown in an uproar and tells Clarke to go and sort it instead of alerting the base.\n\n- When the men arrive at Dogtown, Clarke wades into the dogs attacking the intruder and pulls them away, hacking at the Thing with a hatchet when a Thing limb sends him sprawling.\n\n- Blair is seen at a microscope observing Thing cells assimilating dog cells.\n\n- Nauls is seen finding the shredded clothing in his kitchen.\n\n- At the end of the Long-Johns scene when Child's asks Blair if he believes what the others are discussing, Blair says a few lines about the Thing entering their camp and getting to the dog before it fades to black.\n\n- The Dog Thing examination takes place after Nauls discovers the shredded Long-Johns scene.\n\n- When the men burn the Thing's remains Fuchs protests at the loss to science.

However the essence of the book is captured in the film and it is more faithful than the 1951 version.\n\n-The film updates the setting from the 1930's (around the time the book was published) to what was then present-day in 1982 (the year the film was released).\n\n- In the novel, the American team discover the ship and the Thing, there are no Norwegians, and when the ship is uncovered by the thermite charges it is accidentally destroyed.\n\n- In the novel, they deduce the ship had crashed on Earth ten million years ago. Whereas in the film it was only 100,000 years.\n\n- In the novel there are 37 people stationed at the camp, in this film there are only 12. This may have been done for a number of practical reasons. First, it simplifies the narrative, as in a two-hour film it is easier to develop a smaller cast, not to mention is makes it easier for the audience to learn to identify every character by face. This also may have been done to heighten the drama, as it becomes far more tense when a small group of people who have been working together for months are turned against each other by their paranoia.\n\n- MacReady, Bennings, Clark, Norris, Blair, Copper, and Garry all appear in the novel as their same characters, though Bennings is called \"Benning\", MacReady is spelled \"McReady\" and he's Garry's second-in-command. Whereas in the film, Mac is simply a helicopter pilot who assumes the role of the leader when Garry is suspected of being infected.\n\n- The book is slightly vague on the action sequences (likely in an attempt not to be too gruesome by 1930's standards) but the attack on the dog kennel is in the book as well as the film. Here, the first Thing to be discovered is killed by electricity.\n\n- In the book, electricity is used as the primary means of destroying the Thing. In the film, the characters rely largely on fire in the form of flares and flamethrowers, and in the case of Palmer and Blair, dynamite. This might be just to add a sense of realism, as the original book implied the device used to electrify the Thing was something the crew had thrown together before hand, while flamethrowers are a more practical tool used in Antarctic stations for melting ice.\n\n- In the book, Blair was very eager to thaw out the Thing and once it gets loose, he has a complete nervous breakdown. The group isolate him immediately, the sequence of events take much longer in the film.\n\n- In the novel, the group conclude that they need to isolate themselves and pretend everything is normal over the radio to avoid any rescue attempts until the Thing is discovered and dealt with. In the film, Blair takes it upon himself to isolate the group and the radio had been dead before they realized they had any problems.\n\n- In the book, it's theorized (and ultimately implied) that the Thing is telepathic and can read everyone's thoughts and memories which is why it's able to perfectly imitate anybody including their personalities. In the film, this is never mentioned or theorized. It is more or less implied that when The thing takes over someone, it's simply an exact copy of them down to the very last detail, including thoughts and memories, which is why Norris still has a heart condition even though he's a Thing.\n\n- In the book, Copper comes up with an extremely flawed and rather cruel blood test; A sled dog is conditioned by human blood injections to provide a human-immunity serum test, as in rabbits, which ultimately proves inconclusive because the dog had already been infected. In the film, Copper comes up with a blood serum test of mixing each person's blood with uncontaminated blood.\n\n- In the book, it is implied that the infected people don't know they're Things. In the film, this is a possibility but given the maneuvering the Thing does, the infected people DO know they are not human.\n\n- In the book, more and more people start becoming paranoid and having mental breakdowns due to not knowing if anyone else is human. Ultimately, one of the crew members is murdered and accidentally revealed to be a Thing which gives McReady the idea for his blood test. In this movie, MacReady comes up with his blood test after seeing how the Norris-Thing's head detached from its body in an attempt to save itself.\n\n- In the film, Clark and Garry aren't infected (unless you count Blair killing Garry at the end) and Norris is infected. In the book, it's the opposite.\n\n- The blood test McReady gives is very similar in both the book and the film. Mac's dialogue in the film is almost verbatim from the novel. In the book, everyone takes turns getting tested and when their blood recoils, they're immediately executed and burned. During the blood test, a total of 14 camp members out of the remaining 36 are discovered to be infected and killed, including Garry, Clark and another central character in the novel named Connant. Then a group of the survivors including McReady and Norris go to get Blair and give him the test, where they find he's been building a craft to escape the planet. The group dispatch the creature and that's the end of the novel.\n\n- Copper, Norris, McReady, and roughly half of the 37 survived to the very end of the book and the creature is defeated, giving the book a happy ending. In the film, 10 of the crew (including Copper and Norris) die for certain, the Thing is defeated, but the last two people, MacReady and Childs' fates are left ambiguous, leaving the ending bleak and open to interpretation."]], "0046438": null, "0036775": [["A Note Regarding Spoilers", "The following FAQ entries may contain spoilers.

Dick writes: \"[Billy] Wilder regarded [director] Ernst Lubitsch as the unrivaled master of subtlety. ... In _Double Indemnity_ (qv), the camera dollies back from Phyllis and Neff as they sit snugly on the sofa in his apartment. 'We just sat there,' Neff's voice is heard saying. We no more believe him than we believe the Lubitsch heroine who closes the door of her lover's bedroom and in the next shot awakens in her own.\" (\"Anatomy of Film,\" 1978, pp. 142-143). Roger Ebert seems to agree with this interpretation, but adds \"in 1944 movies you can't be sure [if the characters make love or not], but if they do, it's only the once.\" That this is a question at all is due to the Production Code era, which film scholar James Naremore says forced the directors to learn \"the art of omission\". Had the film been made today, the writer and director probably would have spelled it out for us. Naremore feels _Double Indemnity_ (qv) indeed implies that Walter and Phyllis go to bed: \"At one point she puts her head on his shoulder and cries softly, like the rain on the windows. The camera tracks backward and we dissolve to the insurance office [...] After a few moments, another dissolve returns us to the apartment: time has passed, and Walter and Phyllis are at either end of a sofa; he is reclining and smoking a cigarette while she reapplies her makeup.\" (\"More Than Night: Film Noir in its Contexts,\" 1998, pp. 99)."], ["How is Walter lighting matches like that...using just his fingernail?", "He's using 'strike anywhere' wooden matches, popular in the 1940s. Today's safety matches come with a striking board impregnated with a chemical that the match needs for ignition, so the match can only be lit by use of the striking board. In a 'strike anywhere' match, this chemical was in the white tip, so all you needed was a rough surface to strike it against. If your thumbnail was long enough, you could actually strike a match under it, as did Walter."], ["How does the movie end?", "As morning approaches, Walter winds up his dictation, asking Keyes to break the news gently to Lola ('Jean Heather' (qv)) and to take care of her and Zachetti ('Byron Barr' (qv)). He turns his head to see Keyes listening in the doorway, having been alerted by the janitor that Walter was bleeding. Expecting a lecture with a lot of 'two dollar words', Walter is surprised when Keyes simply says, 'Walter, you're all washed up.' Keyes picks up the phone to call for a doctor, but Walter stops him, saying that he doesn't want to go through the process of healing only so that he can walk into the gas chamber at San Quentin under his own power. Instead, Walter decides to make a run for the Mexican border. He stumbles out into the main office but only makes it to the doorway before collapsing on the floor. Keyes phones for an ambulance then tends to Walter. Breathing heavily, Walter tells Keyes that the reason he couldn't figure this insurance fraud out was because he was too close...right across the desk. 'Closer than that, Walter,' Keyes admits. 'I love you, too,' Walter replies and reaches into his pocket for a cigarette. Keyes strikes a match to light it for him. Together, they wait for the ambulance."], ["Is there an alternate ending?", "The original ending to the movie continued after the present ending through Walter's trial and execution. However, the director eventually decided that the additional material was redundant and depressing, so he cut it for the theatrical release. All the film of the additional scenes has been lost or destroyed, leaving only some still photos, once of which can be seen here."], ["Why did Walter confess?", "Walter knew that he was 'all washed up' and that he'd been used by Phyllis, despite her last attempt to convince him that she had fallen in love with him. He also felt guilty for duping Keyes, someone for whom he felt a real affection. Consequently, he needed to set things right at the end. He needed to confess so that Zachetti wouldn't be pinned as the murderer, thereby depriving Lola of the man she loved, and he needed to tell Keyes how the murder was accomplished and why he couldn't solve this case, perhaps to make him even better equipped as a claims manager...or perhaps just because he cared about Keyes and wanted him to know the truth."], ["Any recommendations for other good film noir from the 1940s and 1950s?", "Film noir (black film) is defined as a film with a dark and pessimistic outlook, usually involving crime, cynical attitudes, manipulative people, and doomed heroes. Those who have seen _Double Indemnity_ (qv) also recommend seeing _The Maltese Falcon (1941)_ (qv) in which murder and criminals surround the search for a gold-encrusted statue of a falcon, _The Big Sleep (1946)_ (qv) in which a detective becomes embroiled in a rich family's problems (and their murders), and _Out of the Past (1947)_ (qv) in which the past catches up with a private eye turned gas station attendant. _The Lost Weekend (1945)_ (qv) follows an alcoholic on a four day drinking bout, and a woman is asked in _Notorious (1946)_ (qv) to spy on a group of her father's Nazi friends.

This would have been easy confirmation for the theory that it had not been Dietrichson on the train, as Keyes had later expressed it to Neff.

He also smells his hands after rubbing them but this is only seen in the first two occurrences. He does so each time before he is involved in combat. These are:1. Before the start of the opening battle sequence in Germania, while he is talking to Quintus.\n2. Before the start of his first gladiator fight in Zucchabar, while Proximo gives the pep talk.\n3. Before the start of his first gladiator fight in Rome (the Colosseum), while in the armoury.\n4. Before the start of his first duel in the Colosseum with Tigris of Gaul.\n5. Very weakly before the start of his final duel in the Colosseum with Commodus.The practical reason for conducting this ritual is to make friction (by absorbing the sweat) between his hands and the object he is holding: it is to form a better grip on his sword, like chalk. The personal reason is to remind Maximus of his villa, which is full of rich memories of the harvest, his wife, his son, his horses and general actions akin to the soil. Director Ridley Scott points this out during his DVD commentary. During the victory celebration after the battle in Germania, there is conversation between Maximus and two of his officers which relate to his villa:Valerius: Back to your barracks, General, or to Rome?\n\nMaximus: Home. The wife, the son, the harvest.\n\nQuintus: Maximus the farmer. I still have difficulty imagining that.\n\nMaximus: You know, dirt cleans off a lot easier than blood, Quintus."], ["What is the German leader yelling prior to the battle?", "Most likely he means to say \"Ihr seid verfluchte Hunde!\", which means \"You are (a bunch of) cursed dogs!\" It is not the German language as we know it today. In the time the movie is set, there was in fact no common \"German language\" but a whole lot of different tribal languages and dialects like those of Angeln, Friesen, Sachsen etc. Those languages were the base of today's German but also (mixed up with the colloquially Latin brought in by the Romans) of many other European languages."], ["Which scenes used CGI to replace Oliver Reed?", "Most notable is his next-to-final scene when he gives the keys to Maximus. You can tell that he was digitally removed from another scene because the focus doesn't change on anything, even though he is moving closer, the lighting is different enough to stand out, and all his new lines are said by an impersonator(added later) while Proximo is off screen. Also, his final line, when he is looking up and says \"shadows and dust.\" right before the soldiers stab him, it's taken from the earlier scene where Maximus argued with him about the vision of Rome and Proximo shouted \"We mortals are but shadows and dust! Shadows and dust Maximus!\" Look in the background during his last line and it is clearly from the arena barracks."], ["Isn't Maximus' accent a bit \"off\", compared to the other actors?", "Most characters playing inhabitants of Rome speak English with a British accent. Russell Crowe's Australian accent indicates that he is from a different region within the Empire. In this case, Hispania (present day Spain), which was a region previously conquered by the Romans, so they would have spoken Latin with an accent. Concomitantly, Hagen (the German gladiator) and Juba (the African gladiator) speak English with a German and African accent respectively."], ["Why wouldn't Quintus allow Commodus a sword after he'd lost his own? Isn't he supposed to follow his ruler's order?", "Maximus had disarmed Commodus fairly in combat and Quintus was observing the rules. Commodus may be emperor but in challenging Maximus to combat, he subjects himself to the same rules as his opponent. His only choices at that point are to retrieve the sword he lost or draw another weapon, and he chose the latter, only to be defeated. The extended edition adds a good deal more to his character's arc than the theatrical version. Two scenes in particular help illustrate this:\n\nWhen Quintus first turns on Maximus he does display guilt to the point that he avoids looking at his old friend, indicating that he was not completely happy with what was going on from the start. A key deleted scene features Commodus forcing Quintus to execute the two Praetorian scouts who reported back that they found the bodies of the men sent to execute Maximus, but mistakenly speculate that they got killed in a barbarian raid. Quintus tries to assert the character he and the other Praetorians know them for and that it was an honest mistake but Commodus does not relent and tests Quintus' loyalty by pressuring him to order their deaths even though he desperately doesn't want to. He ultimately begrudgingly does however. (This also helps in explaining why the other Praetorians could be swayed to defy Commodus in the end as well) Later on, in another deleted scene, before Commodus has his final exchange with Maximus before their duel Quintus goes to him first attempting to clear his conscience of all that has transpired by saying, \"I'm a soldier. I obey.\" Maximus rejects him however. Having seen firsthand the dangerous and mad side of Commodus along with his own guilt, as well as adhering to the rules of the match, leads him to ultimately defying him and ultimately redeeming himself. Which helps give Maximus a greater chance at winning, and ultimately also decides to help try and carry out Maximus' mission when he relays it to him as he dies.\n\nAnother, quite probable reason, is the Praetorians no longer believe him worthy of being Emperor. Several times throughout history, the Praetorian Guard has stepped in to eliminate an Emperor who they believe is not acting in the best interests of the Empire. They also seem to have a deep respect for Maximus, as shown after he defeats Tigris. After Commodus tries to bait Maximus into attacking, which fails, the two Praetorians Maximus walks up to (between him and the exit to the gladiator barracks) lower their weapons and let him pass without orders, even inclining their heads in a respectful bow."], ["Why did the slave trader suddenly say he'd bought Juba \"in a salt mine in Carthage\"?", "Juba had said he was a hunter. The slave trader probably didn't want Proximo to buy Juba because he could have been sold at a higher price elsewhere to a different customer. However, Proximo saw right through the ruse knowing that Juba would make a great gladiator -- not even the slave trader could hide Juba's muscular physique."], ["What are the differences between the Theatrical version and the Extended Cut?", "Several years after its initial release an Extended Cut got published on DVD (and later on Blu-Ray) that runs approx. 16 minutes longer than the more familiar theatrical version. All of the scenes that were restored for this version had previously been included as deleted scenes on previous DVD releases. The restored scenes are mainly character moments, though some deserve singling out, e.g., (1) Proximo tells Maximus to be \"entertaining\" before his first fight as a _Gladiator_ (qv). This gives context to Maximus shouting the question \"Were you not entertained?!\" and throwing his sword into the balcony after his victory; (2) Lucilla is seen secretly meeting with the senators, Graccus and Gaius, for the first time, much earlier in the narrative than in the theatrical cut of the film. This indicates far earlier her unhappiness with Commodus' rule, even stating her brother has to die; and (3) There are the various scenes featuring Maximus' former ally, Quintus, being forced to follow Commodus' orders, leading to the soldier eventually betraying his Emperor.

When Juba fights with Hagen (using wooden swords), he fights pretty fiercely and receives a red mark on this tunic on orders from Proximo himself. Proximo seems to be the the sole judge of the candidates. He sees that Juba has a fighter's spirit & it puts him at the top of the running. Maximus blatantly refuses to fight and receives a yellow mark that puts him somewhere in the middle of the candidates, however Proximo probably senses that Maximus will one day become a great gladiator. He does, primarily because of his need for revenge."], ["Did the Roman Colosseum really have a canopy system to provide shade to the spectators?", "Historians and archeologists have been searching for many years for evidence that there was an awning or velarium to provide shade. Coins and other artifacts have been found showing the Colosseum with the awning and there are pieces of stone called corbels on the outer facade of the Colosseum (and other, more intact Roman amphitheaters around the Mediterranean Sea) that would have supported wooden masts for this purpose.

That episode can be seen here."], ["Why did Commodus murder Maximus' family?", "Commodus was clearly always jealous of Maximus. Marcus always favoured his General Maximus over his own son, Commodus. Marcus even privately told Maximus that he was the son he should have had. Commodus was also in love with his own sister, Lucilla, but even she loved Maximus. (It's implied that Lucilla and Maximus had a relationship when they were younger). Commodus had grown up with the expectation of succeeding his father as Caesar. When Marcus breaks the news that Maximus would succeed him and not Commodus, it was more than Commodus could take. Enraged, he murders his own father, before he could make the public announcement of succession. Commodus becomes the rightful heir as far as the public knows. Commodus offers his hand to Maximus, essentially saying that Maximus can continue being a loyal servant to him. Maximus refuses, knowing that Commodus killed Marcus. Commodus takes this opportunity to order his Praetorians to secretly kidnap Maximus and have him executed. Commodus also orders the death of Maximus' family as a token of vengeance due to Commodus' own family choosing Maximus over him. Furthermore, the family of traitors almost always are slain as well, to ensure they don't try to get revenge or achieve the treason their family member failed in."]], "0208092": [["A Note Regarding Spoilers", "The following FAQ entries may contain spoilers.

By mentioning that he did something like this to Starling, he's reminding her of what he is and, more so, of what he's capable of and how he regards selected people or people in general. On the other hand, apart from containing alcohol, a Chianti is likely to be rich in tyramine - especially the more so when aged, whereas fava beans also contain a considerable amount of tyramine. Liver that is usually eaten from animals can also be high in tyramine. For obvious reasons, less is known about how a human liver differs in its constituents from that of an animal in regards to diet, potential poisoning and specific interactions.

Until the release of this film, it'd been done many times by other characters in other movies. So it wasn't too hard for the writers to convince us that Hannibal could do the same thing. Also, he's an inventive genius, which makes it even more believable. In Thomas Harris' novel, the escape is almost exactly the same. Hannibal does steal a pen, though it wasn't Chilton's, it belonged to an attendant who had carelessly left it behind. Hannibal spends weeks cutting the shaft of the ink cartridge using only a small burr on a bolt that holds his bunk bed against the wall of his cell. When he has a length of the shaft cut to the right size, he cuts 2 small grooves in it lengthwise. He hides it in his cheek, and a scan with a metal detecting wand misses it. In his new cell, while guarded by Pembry and Boyle, he uses the pen tip to bend the section of the shaft outward, making a key that he uses to undo the cuffs. The movie makes the scene a bit simpler, probably to save time and control the pacing."], ["How could Hannibal possibly overpower both Pembry and Boyle? It was two armed men against one prisoner.", "Aside from the obvious answers like Hannibal undoing his cuffs with a piece of the pen he stole from Chilton, the bigger issue is that Boyle and Pembry didn't have the kind of respect for Hannibal's inventive genius that Barney did at the institution in Baltimore. Essentially, they considered Hannibal to be merely a prisoner to babysit. Hannibal's plan from the beginning was to get himself transferred away from Chilton (who he considered a tormentor). If you watch the beginning of the escape scene, you can easily see the mistakes Boyle and Pembry make: Boyle puts the tray on the floor near Hannibal when he rolls up the sketches (with the sketches placed on the table that Hannibal eats from, this may have also been part of Hannibal's plan; Boyle probably should've handed the tray to Pembry.) Pembry, when removing the key from the lock, is standing around much too casually, not watching Hannibal closely enough, and even turns his back on him and begins to walk out of the cage.) Additionally, Boyle probably should not have been allowed to carry a pocket knife as a personal item when working with so dangerous a prisoner. In the end, Hannibal, over the course of a few days or so that he was incarcerated in Memphis, had ample enough time to observe both men and to discern the weaknesses in their procedures.\n\nIn the novel, it's explained in detail that Barney \"never forgot what he was dealing with\" in terms of his relationship with Lecter. Barney had probably been working as an orderly with mental patients for years, even before Lecter was incarcerated at his facility, so Barney probably had years of experience dealing with clever inmates like Lecter."], ["Why does Clarice believe that \"Jack Gordon\" is actually Buffalo Bill?", "Her suspicions are aroused when \"Gordon\" asks if Frederika Bimmell was \"a great big fat person.\" Lecter pointed out that all of the victims were larger women, because the killer wants their skins to fit onto a man's body. That Gumb's first thought of a woman he didn't otherwise recognize was her size was enough to make Starling want to find out more. Once inside his house, Clarice recognizes the Death's Head moth in the living room. Gumb gives his name as \"Jack Gordon.\" Those initials, J.G., are consistent with \"Jame Gumb\" and \"John Grant,\" both aliases named by Crawford."], ["How does the movie end?", "From Lecter's advice -- that Bill covets that which he sees every day -- Clarice and Ardelia deduce that the first victim could have been someone who Bill knew personally. Clarice drives to Belvedere, Ohio to talk with the father of the first victim, Frederika Bimmel. In looking over Frederika's bedroom, Clarice finds a music box ballerina, in which she finds a false bottom that contains pictures obviously missed during previous investigations. On the pictures, Frederika is seen posing, wearing only underwear, suggesting that there was indeed an unknown man in her life who took the pictures, most likely her murderer. Clarice goes through a wardrobe and notices the triangular gussets on Frederika's dresses match the pieces of skin Bill cut from one of his victims. Clarice calls Jack Crawford ('Scott Glenn' (qv)) to inform him that Bill is making a \"woman suit\" of real skin. Crawford is already in route to Chicago, having identified Bill as Jame Gumb, but they find that the house where he's supposedly living has been abandoned. Clarice continues to poke around in Belvedere and interviews one of Frederika's friends, who points to the house of \"old Mrs Littman\" where she was often hanging around. Mrs Littman doesn't live there any more, but the current resident, who calls himself Jack Gordon, offers to give her Mrs Littman's son's business card and invites Clarice inside to wait. When she notices spools of thread and a Death's-Head moth, she realizes that Jack Gordon is really Jame \"Buffalo Bill\" Gumb. She pulls her gun on him, but Gumb leads her on a wild goose chase into the basement, where he has Catherine Martin imprisoned in a well. Gumb dons a night vision mask and turns out the lights, leaving Clarice to feel around in the dark. When he makes the mistake of cocking his gun, Clarice shoots him. Catherine is subsequently rescued. In the final scenes, Clarice is shown graduating from the Academy. At the party that follows, she receives a phone call from Lecter, calling from the airport on the island of Bimini in the Bahamas. He assures her that he's not about to come looking for her and requests that she extend him the same courtesy, which Clarice cannot do, of course. He then says that he must hang up because \"I'm having an old friend for dinner,\" as he watches Dr. Frederick Chilton deplane."], ["What happens to Dr. Chilton?", "The closing, where Hannibal says: \"I'm having an old friend for dinner\" as he watches Dr. Chilton deplane, strongly suggests that Chilton ended up as one of Hannibal's meals. A small reference was made in the sequel novel Hannibal, where it was mentioned that Chilton disappeared seven years earlier while on vacation, strongly suggesting Hannibal had gotten his revenge (albeit in the novel, Chilton disappeared in Jamaica, not the Bahamas). However, this is never specifically stated in the sequel movie. The only reference to Dr. Chilton in Hannibal is made by Barney, when he says that Lecter, when possible, preferred to eat \"the rude,\" and Dr. Chilton \"was a bad man,\" which also strongly implies Chilton became Hannibal's victim."], ["Is Hannibal Lecter sociopathic, psychopathic, or something else?", "In the novel Red Dragon, Will Graham calls Lecter a \"pure sociopath,\" but makes a point in mentioning that he only calls him this because a more appropriate term doesn't exist, meaning Lecter doesn't actually fit any psychological profile.This is echoed in the film version of _The Silence of the Lambs_ (qv), where Dr. Chilton refers to Lecter as a \"pure psychopath,\" but given Chilton's incompetence, it makes sense that he would term Lecter's pathology so simply. Another reference to Graham's description in Red Dragon is made when Clarice tells a young security guard in the Tennessee asylum that \"they don't have a name\" for what Lecter is. According to the film's director, Jonathan Demme, Lecter is a good man trapped in an insane mind. 'Anthony Hopkins' (qv) plays him as a refined, eloquent and seductive character who is very careful and cunning in his crimes. This is more in line with a sociopathic pathology, as sociopaths are known to be more organized in their actions. If you consider the prequel novel Hannibal Rising to be canon (which many fans of the Lecter mythology don't), it is suggested that Hannibal's pathology is a result of irreparable trauma he suffered as a child; however, others contest this simple summary of the novel, and maintain that Lecter's childhood trauma is merely one, if not the main event that causes his already sociopathic tendencies to manifest themselves at a young age; this is suggested by Hannibal continuing to murder people, even after dealing with the people responsible for the trauma. In other words, Lecter would have become a serial killer anyway, but events from his childhood simply accelerated the process and provided him with a special focus. Some viewers even maintain that Lecter isn't actually insane at all but does horrific things simply because he wants to and is smart enough to get away with them. They maintain that the people in the novels and films refer to Lecter as insane simply because it's easier to term him as such; it gives them a false sense of security and makes them feel that they know how Lecter's mind works when they actually have no idea. Simply put, it's possible that Lecter is a sociopath or a psychopath but, considering Graham's description, it's much more likely that Lecter is just pure evil."], ["Why does Hannibal treat Barney Matthews so well?", "Over the years that Hannibal is incarcerated, Barney develops respect for Lecter's ingenuity and intelligence, not to mention, respects how dangerous Lecter is. Lecter develops respect for Barney's courteous and kind manner, and in the sequel, Barney points out that he never felt in danger after Lecter's jailbreak, as Lecter preferred to eat \"the rude\". In the novel, Lecter and Barney have a short exchange before Lecter is transferred: Lecter thanks Barney for being decent to him, and Barney accepts and wishes him well."], ["Is this film a sequel to Manhunter?", "There are two schools of thought on this. One could certainly argue that _The Silence of the Lambs_ (qv) is a sequel to Manhunter, since it features three of the same characters from Manhunter, that is, Hannibal Lecter, Jack Crawford, and Dr. Frederick Chilton (played respectively by 'Brian Cox' (qv), 'Dennis Farina' (qv), and 'Benjamin Hendrickson' (qv) in Manhunter and 'Anthony Hopkins' (qv), 'Scott Glenn' (qv), and 'Anthony Heald' (qv) in _The Silence of the Lambs_ (qv)). On the other hand, Manhunter was not a successful film, which is why Dino De Laurentiis chose not to produce this film. When _The Silence of the Lambs_ (qv) was released, it was not marketed as a sequel to Manhunter. All references from the book that mention Will \"the Red Dragon\" Graham have been excised from the film. The two returning cast members, 'Frankie Faison' (qv) and 'Dan Butler' (qv), play different roles. It's also worth noting that in early drafts, when the producers were not sure if they could use the characters from Manhunter, Ted Tally changed those characters' names to cut all ties with Manhunter. They were eventually changed back. However, given that Tally also wrote the screenplay for Red Dragon, which featured three out of four actors returning to their roles, including Faison playing his Silence role, it is more likely that Manhunter is meant to be part of a separate continuity, while Red Dragon is meant to be a direct prequel to _The Silence of the Lambs_ (qv)."], ["What are the differences between the Theatrical Version and the Workprint?", "There are some differences between the Workprint version and the Theatrical Release.

Seven hundred (700) years later, only one WALL-E (voice of 'Benjamin A. Burtt' (qv)) remains on the planet, going about his job compacting trash into cubes and stacking them, with only his pet cockroach and a _Hello, Dolly! (1969)_ (qv) video to keep him company. Then one day, an Extraterrestrial Vegetation Evaluator (EVE) probe (voice of 'Elissa Knight' (qv)) arrives to scout for any evidence that the Earth might be ready for recolonization. WALL-E falls in love with EVE and follows her back to the Axiom where the two embark on a mission to save the Earth."], ["Is the film based on a book?", "_WALL\u00b7E_ (qv) is based on an original script by American screenwriter Andrew Stanton, who also directed the film. Stanton has said in interviews that the idea behind the _WALL\u00b7E_ (qv) character was the last of the thoughts discussed at the now legendary 1994 lunch meeting where he, John Lasseter, Pete Docter, and Joe Ranft came up with ideas that were central to many of Pixar's most iconic films. As Stanton described, it was \"the loneliest scenario I'd ever heard\" with a robot left on Earth, somehow the last one never switched off, endlessly doing his job. Stanton continued to think about and develop the character from that point onward and even \"procrastinated\" while working on Finding Nemo to write parts of _WALL\u00b7E_ (qv). He conceptualized possibly the most emotionally important physical characteristic of _WALL\u00b7E_ (qv), his camera \"eyes,\" when he was handed a pair of binoculars at a baseball game. He found himself completely enthralled by how just by moving the lenses up and down he could make the binoculars express different emotions, which ultimately became the primary way the character does so. The idea behind _WALL\u00b7E_ (qv) therefore was first and foremost to imbue non-living items with life and emotions ranging from the most extreme loneliness to the most fulfilled love. As Stanton puts it, \"that challenge haunts all animators. We grow up thinking that our bike is cold when it's left out in the rain or that a leaf on a high branch is afraid of heights. _WALL\u00b7E_ (qv) tapped into the pure possibilities of animation.\""], ["In what year does the movie take place?", "According to the year shown in the DVD exclusive short BURN\u00b7E, the story begins in the year 2805. Other time references given include the starting date of Captain Reardon's service (the apparent first captain of the Axiom) in the year 2105, as listed under his portrait, the captain's announcement of day 255,642 aboard the Axiom (celebrating of the 700-year anniversary of the original five-year mission), and directive A113 being sent in the year 2110 (\"nearly 700 years ago\"). Strangely, \"2815 A.D.\" is the title of the second track on the official soundtrack album, the first original song in the movie, the only apparent contradiction to the year 2805."], ["What happened to all of the other _WALL\u00b7E_ (qv)s?", "In the official production notes and interviews, writer/director Andrew Stanton has consistently said that the essential concept behind the character of _WALL\u00b7E_ (qv) is \"what if mankind had to leave Earth, and somebody forgot to turn off the last robot?\" The BNL corporation initially had a plan to return to Earth. Based on Stanton's concept, it is likely that when their clean-up plan failed, they intentionally turned off all the _WALL\u00b7E_ (qv) units, somehow missing only one."], ["Was the _WALL\u00b7E_ (qv) we meet the only one with a personality or did those others have personalities too?", "Stanton has said in interviews that he never really thought about how _WALL\u00b7E_ (qv) got his personality or if the other _WALL\u00b7E_ (qv)s had personalities too. We see in the story, however, a glimpse of how unsophisticated those personalities might have been when the character temporarily loses his memory and personality. This makes it seem as though, over time and perhaps due to his many self-repairs, along with his need for extreme independence to achieve his directive and his centuries of exposure to human artifacts, _WALL\u00b7E_ (qv) develops a unique personality far beyond the basic level of interaction with his environment for which he was built. Another possibility, shown throughout the movie, is that the robots are generally not completely predictable machines, with something as simple as a break from routine causing them to show what we would call personality. One example is M-O, who shows what could be interpreted as either displeasure or excitement at being made to clean a 100% contaminated _WALL\u00b7E_ (qv). Another is EVE, who shows a personality in a variety of ways as she encounters things on Earth. Other robots wave, try new things, or show support for _WALL\u00b7E_ (qv) as they weave in and out of his story."], ["Was EVE sapient before she met _WALL\u00b7E_ (qv), or was it exposure to his personality that created hers?", "While EVE begins the story deeply committed to her directive, she already seems to be sapient and has a complex personality that includes emotions. She shows this personality in a number of different ways before she meets _WALL\u00b7E_ (qv). Examples include: (1) EVE seems to enjoy flying. Immediately after she becomes active, she begins following her directive to search for plant life. However, after she watches her ship depart, she stops her search for almost a minute of apparently nonproductive flight. (2) EVE is entranced by _WALL\u00b7E_ (qv)'s pet cockroach. As soon as she realizes it is not a threat, she reaches out to it, lets it climb all over her, and even laughs at the sensations it produces. The cockroach's relationship to _WALL\u00b7E_ (qv) also seems to be part of the reason she decides that he, too, is not a threat. (3) EVE shows frustration, anger, and depression. As her search begins to seem fruitless and she is temporarily trapped by a magnet, she takes out her frustration on a ship. After doing so, her expression and body language indicate a sense of depression with arms slumped and eyes half shut. After that darker demonstration of her existing personality, in this seemingly vulnerable state, EVE finally takes the time to meet _WALL\u00b7E_ (qv), learn his name and function, and teach him to pronounce her name. She even giggles in a clear indication that she finds the way he mispronounces her name endearing."], ["Why does EVE have a gun if she is supposed to be searching for life on Earth?", "When EVE probes were created by the BNL in the 2100s, they were given gun-arms. The primary reason for this was because of the possibility of needing to remove obstacles (for example, when EVE is trapped by a ship's electromagnet, and she escapes by blasting it away)."], ["How could the plant grow without sunlight or get into a refrigerator that hadn't been opened for hundreds of years?", "The door to the fridge is actually leaning on the main body of the fridge, not attached or sealed, which is why _WALL\u00b7E_ (qv) is able to get it out of the way with a single cut. Even if it were attached and closed, though, by their nature seeds find their way into all sorts of weird places. Seeds getting into a rusty old fridge that likely had holes and cracks all over it isn't too hard to believe. Seeds can be incredibly tough. In one well-known experiment, NASA exposed tomato seeds to the harsh environment of space, including cosmic radiation, for over five years. When brought back to earth and planted, most of them still grew normally. The intact parts of the fridge probably helped protect the sprouted plant from intense sunlight, dry air, and dust storms. Even so, it had pretty much just sprouted, and may well not have kept growing if _WALL\u00b7E_ (qv) hadn't discovered it. As an important point of story resolution, we do finally see what it grows into during the credits, after all the help it gets from both robots and humans."], ["Why were the people on the ship so overweight?", "The writers and filmmakers behind _WALL\u00b7E_ (qv) have stated explicitly that the size of the Axiom's passengers and command staff was not because of obesity or lifestyle, but rather because of bone loss caused by the many years spent in microgravity. Stanton and co. researched what would happen to human beings after many years in microgravity (via NASA) and loss of bone density is one of the key things scientists told them."], ["What were the names of the past captains of the Axiom and how long were their terms of service?", "According to plaques under each of the portraits in the captain's quarters, the Axiom has had 6 captains including our current, Captain McCrea. The past captains all served very long terms by modern standards of over 120 years, with some as long as 140. All are named for Pixar employees:\n\nCaptain Reardon (named for Jim Reardon, writer), 2105-2245.\n\nCaptain Fee (named for Brian Fee, storyboard artist), 2246-2379.\n\nCaptain Thompson (named for Rob Duquette Thompson, animator), 2380 - 2520.\n\nCaptain Brace (named for Maxwell Brace IV, story artist), 2521 - 2645.\n\nCaptain O'Brien (named for Kevin O'Brien, storyboard artist), 2646-2774.\n\nCaptain B. McCrea, 2775 to present (2805)."], ["What do the different robots' names stand for?", "_WALL\u00b7E_ (qv) is short for \"Waste Allocation Load Lifter Earth-Class\" (and is referred to as \"Wally\" throughout the screenplay, which can be downloaded from the official site). EVE is short for \"Extra-terrestrial Vegetation Evaluator\", WALL\u00b7A is likely short for \"Waste Allocation Load Lifter Axiom-Class\" (or it could be \"Arkology-Class\", since the Axiom wasn't by far the only ship launched by BNL), and M-O is short for \"Microbe Obliterator\". AUTO (\"Otto\") is, of course, short for \"Autopilot\". Other robots whose names seem to be clever plays on words but may not be acronyms or abbreviations include BURN\u00b7E (\"Bernie\", a welding robot), VAQ-M (a vacuum cleaner), VN-GO (a painting bot), PR-T (a beautician bot), HAN-S (a masseuse bot), D-FIB (a defibrillator), L-T (a desk lamp), and B-RLA (an umbrella)."], ["Who is BURN\u00b7E?", "BURN\u00b7E is a small welding robot. He is shown briefly and comically frustrated when he is locked outside of an airlock at the end of _WALL\u00b7E_ (qv) and EVE's dance scene. Similar to the animated short included on the DVD version of The Incredibles, Pixar tells the rest of his story in an animated short included on _WALL\u00b7E_ (qv)'s DVD release."], ["Why are there so few humans returning? Is the human race really that reduced now?", "There are almost certainly other ships, probably many other ships, though we are never explicitly told if humans survived on them as they have on the Axiom. The Axiom is described in 700 year-old advertisements as the \"jewel\" (i.e., the flagship) of a BNL fleet of ships. The CEO of BNL says in a short ad during the introductory sequence that ships are leaving for space \"every day,\" indicating there are likely dozens if not hundreds of such ships in space. The fact that they appear not to cluster together and do not communicate with each other is strange but not hard to accept, given that the other AUTOs are (presumably) continuing to follow directive A113 (full control of the ship) and are directed to \"stay the course\" and \"never return to Earth\". The CEO's directive A113 message is addressed to \"autopilots,\" plural. You also may notice that the audio of the CEO's recorded message to the captain changes tone abruptly when he says \"the Axiom\" while explaining that the ship will automatically return to Earth. This is likely intended to show that the same message exists on every ship to be triggered under the appropriate circumstances, with only the name edited in for each unique vessel. Whether the Axiom is capable of contacting its sister ships to rescind Directive A113, or issue a recall order of sorts (telling them that Earth is safe for human habitation once more and ordering their AUTOs to return immediately), is unknown at this point.\nOn the DVD bonus features there are several BNL Shorts and one of them clearly shows several ships just like the Axiom taking off, showing that the world population has been split between many ships."], ["How did _WALL\u00b7E_ (qv) retain his personality after being damaged and having his motherboard replaced?", "_WALL\u00b7E_ (qv) units and robots in general most likely would hold memories and other elements that define personality on some future storage medium functionally similar to a modern hard drive or solid state drive. Every component of _WALL\u00b7E_ (qv) that we see is recognizably similar to modern technology, yet we never see anything that resembles an HD or SSD. We do not see one damaged or as part of the repairs EVE makes. It's reasonable to assume that means this part of _WALL\u00b7E_ (qv) survives the attack. We do see a board replaced that might be his motherboard, a storage interface with an on-board cache, a self-contained memory unit, or some other very important piece of equipment. It could even be some means of regulating his electrical power source, given how he almost completely loses his charge during the attack that causes the damage but otherwise continues to function. Whatever this item is, when replaced it is possible that it took some time for his long-term storage medium to fill his working memory back up with data. It's reasonable that _WALL\u00b7E_ (qv) continued functioning in a basic manner while this process was taking place, in a kind of \"recovery mode\". Once the recovery process was complete, _WALL\u00b7E_ (qv) remembered and was himself again. It's worth mentioning, though, that EVE's love has a tangible, electrical form. Each time she \"kisses\" _WALL\u00b7E_ (qv) on the forehead we see a small electrical spark, so there could be some crossover between the technical explanation and the thematic (love story) explanation. It is possible that EVE's kiss actually kick-started some important part of _WALL\u00b7E_ (qv)'s recovery process."], ["Was M-O a rogue robot?", "In the scene when M-O was cleaning the EVE units and encounters _WALL\u00b7E_ (qv) we see him step outside the white boundary. This mere action seems to indicate that he was no longer operating in his indicated parameters. So, yes he was a \"rogue\"."], ["How was Operation Clean-up supposed to work?", "According to Andrew Stanton in the Behind the Scenes Preview at Amazon.com, the plan for Operation Clean-up is as follows. After the _WALL\u00b7E_ (qv) units compact the trash and build it into towers:It then allows these large city-block wide sized incinerators that are on big tank treads, to sort of roll in, and like a hay baler with a big crane that can slice the towers down into digestible sections and incinerate them.So, in other words, the plan was to use large machinery to incinerate massive sections of trash at once, after the _WALL\u00b7E_ (qv) units had cubed and stacked it."], ["How does the movie end?", "Captain McCrea is able to shut off AUTO, allowing EVE to place the plant in the holo-detector which identifies the point of origin and hyperjumps the Axiom back to Earth. But WALL-E is severely crushed in the process of preventing AUTO from collapsing the holo-detector. Once back on Earth, EVE rushes WALL-E to his garage where she is able to make repairs on WALL-E from the spare parts he has stored there. When WALL-E's solar panel is recharged, EVE extends her hand to him, but WALL-E turns his back, not recognizing her or her gesture. Frantically, EVE tries to refresh his memory by showing him the light bulb and the Rubik's cube, but WALL-E simply adds them to his trash compactor and heads outside to collect more trash. EVE follows, calling his name and shaking him, but there is no response. Heartbroken, EVE intertwines her fingers with WALL-E's fingers and gives him an electric kiss. Suddenly, WALL-E's fingers tighten around EVE's fingers, and his eyes begin to click. 'Eve-ah?' he asks. EVE replies with a slight giggle, and they put their foreheads together. In the final scene, McCrea shows the humans how they're going to learn to grow plants like vegetable plants and pizza plants. As the camera pans back, patches of greenery are shown springing up outside the city."], ["Is there a scene after the credits?", "Not in the original version, but animation during the end credits continues the story through imagery that mimics art periods throughout history. We see humanity rebuilding civilization on Earth and get an idea of EVE and _WALL\u00b7E_ (qv)'s ultimate fates. We also see an abridged retelling of the film with the characters portrayed in \"8-bit\" pixellation-style drawings. After the Walt Disney Pictures and Pixar Animation Studios logos is a BNL logo. The Regions 1, 2, and 5 DVD of the film contain an alternate version of the familiar Pixar studio animation, where Luxo Jr's lightbulb burns out rather than simply being turned off. _WALL\u00b7E_ (qv) enters the picture, replaces the bulb with a CF (compact fluorescent) lightbulb and, while attempting to leave the frame, knocks over the letter \"R\" in \"PIXAR\". _WALL\u00b7E_ (qv) then takes its place, with his hands forming the upper-right part of the letter and his compactor door taking the place of the letter's right \"foot\"."], ["Any recommendations for other movies by Pixar Animation Studios?", "If you like Pixar's animation in Wall-E, you'll certainly want to see some of the other Pixar productions, including _Toy Story (1995)_ (qv) and its sequels -- _Toy Story 2 (1999)_ (qv) and _Toy Story 3 (2010)_ (qv) -- and perhaps _A Bug's Life (1998)_ (qv), _Monsters, Inc.

However, the director has admitted to having watched Short Circuit before and acknowledges that it may have subconsciously influenced the design of _WALL\u00b7E_ (qv). His body was designed for the eyes to show emotions, tank-like treads so he could handle all terrains, and a body with the ability to retract his head and limbs like a turtle. One minor feature of Johnny 5 that _WALL\u00b7E_ (qv) does not share was a pair of metal shades over the eye lens. These covers functioned as both eyelids and eyebrows, and slowly moved (quite a bit) like butterfly wings. They were important to Johnny 5's look. The fact that _WALL\u00b7E_ (qv) does not have them supports the director's account: _WALL\u00b7E_ (qv)'s lenses get damaged during the movie and he certainly could have benefited from \"lens lids.\" In short, the similarities are very remarkable although the director has stated that _WALL\u00b7E_ (qv) is an original design."], ["What's that middle dot in _WALL\u00b7E_ (qv)'s name and how do I make it?", "The dot between the \"WALL\" and the \"E\" is called an interpunct.

Others think that he might have been planning to murder Col. Nicholson now that the job was done. Follow the scene closely, and you will see him cut off a lock of his hair and roll it up in the note.

As the whistle of the train signals its approach, Joyce must make the decision to either blow up the bridge before anyone notices the wires or wait until the train is passing over it as per orders. While walking across the bridge, admiring his work, Nicholson suddenly notices the wire. He and Saito follow the wire and realize that the bridge has been mined. Suddenly, Joyce jumps out from cover and stabs Saito. Calling for help from the Japanese, Nicholson leaps on Joyce. While Warden yells at Joyce to kill Nicholson, Joyce tries to explain that he's acting under orders from British command to blow up the bridge. Japanese guns begin firing, and Joyce is hit. Spears starts swimming across the river to set off the detonator, but he is hit several times by Japanese fire, finally collapsing at Nicholson's feet. Nicholson suddenly realizes the extent of the situation and asks himself, \"What have I done?\", just as Warden shoots off a mortar that explodes nearby, hitting him. Severely wounded, Nicholson staggers toward the detonator, falling on it just as the train begins to cross the bridge. The bridge explodes under the train, causing it to derail into the river.

In the excitement of the moment, one cameraman forgot to give his signal. The train came across the bridge (it too had been manned by someone who jumped off before it reached the bridge) and the director didn't give the detonate signal because of the one cameraman.

It was Clarke's belief that Kubrick intentionally delayed signing off on Clarke's version so that the movie would be released first.

They are placed to observe and, in Kubrick's words, \"influence\" the \"evolutionary progression\" of humanity. Each of the three monoliths has a different purpose. The hominids' contact with the first, in the \"Dawn of Man\" sequence, sparked the discovery of tools/weapons. The second, found on the moon, emitted a powerful radio signal directed at Jupiter. While the monolith is activated by sunlight in the novel, it is completely lit by artificial lighting in the film when it emits its signal. The lunar night is too long for the sun to rise during the short time Floyd is at the site. The confusion arises due to an edit (what may be a time cut) to the sun appearing above the monolith. The third, located at the Lagrange point between Io and Jupiter, either leads to and opens or is itself the door to the stargate transporting Bowman to his destiny. A monolith appears at the foot of Bowman's bed immediately before his transformation and it sends him, as the Starchild, back to Earth. Whether this is the same monolith that sent him through the Stargate, as Kubrick's own comments suggest, or a different monolith, as certain interpreters believe, remains a question open to debate. Not pointed out in the movie: The monoliths are 1 \u00d7 4 \u00d7 9 in dimension\u20141 squared by 2 squared by 3 squared (or in short, 1\u00b2 \u00d7 2\u00b2 \u00d7 3\u00b2), as stated in Clarke's novel and also in the film's sequel, _2010_ (qv). The \"Odyssey\" books by Arthur C. Clarke reveal that the monoliths are alien supercomputers capable of self replication.

It cost 750,000 USD."], ["Would a centrifuge like that on Discovery generate artificial gravity?", "A qualified yes. The equivalence principle states that force due to gravity is indistinguishable from the effects observed within an accelerating reference frame, and rotation is a form of acceleration. Therefore, the effects resulting from centripetal acceleration within such a centrifuge could be called \"artificial gravity.\" However, with the radius and rate of rotation depicted in the film, the result would be only one-tenth the acceleration due to Earth's gravity. \"Normal\" acceleration with a radius of 10 metres would require a rotation of 10 RPM, which would produce severe Coriolis effects. Fred Ordway, the Marshall Spaceflight Center engineer who was technical adviser on the film, noted that the centrifuge, in reality, would have to have been larger, but the studio sound stage in England would only accommodate movie sets up to a certain size."], ["Wouldn't the Discovery's centrifuge impart a spin to the ship?", "No. That would happen only if the rate of rotation was accelerated or braked (whether by friction or otherwise). In all three cases\u2014accelerating, steady, or braking\u2014the ship's total angular momentum remains constant unless it is acted upon by an outside force.

This game was based on a game played between Willi Schlage, a tournament player, and a mysterious person named Roesch\u2014mysterious, because nobody seems to know his first name, and there is some disagreement in what year this game was played. Roesch makes several beginner's mistakes. The fact that an otherwise insignificant game is recorded implies that this was a teaching game. It's certainly not a tournament game as has been suggested. From this information, we know that Poole is a beginner and, perhaps, learned the game on-board the Discovery to pass the time. Although HAL incompletely describes the checkmate setup, he was accurate in declaring victory. In addition to the moves he describes, HAL can also win by playing Nh3. Poole then would be forced to play Qh6 in order to prevent his queen being taken by a pawn. Then, there would be no way Poole could stop HAL. This shouldn't be seen as a mistake, because Kubrick was famous for paring down dialogue in order to speed up the pace of a film. For more information, see here."], ["Is HAL a computer?", "The depiction of the HAL 9000 (Heuristically-programmed Algorithmic Computer) in 2001 remains one of the film's most eerie elements. For their description of artificial intelligence, Kubrick and Clarke only had the terminology of the mid-1960s. At that time, the prevailing concept was that Artificial Intelligence (AI) was expected to be a programmed computer. Thus, the term computer, with all its implications of it being a machine, occurs repeatedly. In the last 40 years, no true AI has emerged. Today's corresponding term would be \"strong AI.\" Kubrick and Clarke's use of mid-1960s terminology obscures the fact that the film and novel authors constructed an AI that is unmistakably strong-that is, capable of \"general intelligent action.\" How this would have been achieved Kubrick and Clarke left as an extrapolation. Clarke provides a little extrapolation in the novel: Probably no one would ever know this: it did not matter. In the 1980s, Minsky and Good had shown how neural networks could be generated automatically\u2014self-replicated\u2014in accordance with an arbitrary learning program. Artificial brains could be grown by a process strikingly analogous to the development of the human brain. In any given case, the precise details would never be known, and even if they were, they would be millions of times too complex for human understanding. (From: A. C. Clarke (_2001: A Space Odyssey_ (qv), ROC edition, trade paper back, 2005, bottom page 92 - top page 93.)"], ["Is HAL in absolute control of the Discovery?", "No.\n(1) We (and HAL) see and hear Dave and Frank talking about disconnecting HAL, if this were done there would have to be backup means of controlling the ship.\n(2) When Dave goes to get Frank's body there is an insert display showing that Dave had cut HAL's control of the POD.\n(3) There is an emergency airlock over which HAL had no control.\nFor these and other reasons the designers of the Discovery had to have built-in redundancy, backups to HAL; no complex spacecraft is ever designed without such redundancy."], ["What explains HAL's actions towards the end of the film?", "There are two major schools of thought on this question that reflect different interpretations of the movie. In the recorded message which plays after Dave has \"lobotomized\" HAL, Dr. Floyd reveals the computer has known the nature of the mission all along. This is confirmed by Dr. Chandra in the sequel movie, _2010_ (qv) who supplies the additional information that HAL was instructed not to reveal the mission's purpose until the appropriate time. Meanwhile, Dave and Frank have not been told for security reasons. This leads HAL to develop \"paranoia\" because withholding information directly contravenes his base programming to present all data without alteration or omission. One notes that this explanation is contained in Clarke's novel, only there is no directly explicit explanation given by Kubrick in the film. This basic material has inspired two different viewpoints: (1) HAL knows that Bowman and Poole intend to disconnect his higher brain functions if the AE-35 does not fail as he predicted. HAL knows he made the error and therefore he expects to be disconnected, the AI equivalent of death. On the most basic level, HAL is simply acting in self defense. This view is the most straightforward, but its detractors feel it does not account for all of HAL's behavior. (2) HAL turns lethal because he develops a paranoid belief that the crew cannot be trusted to complete the mission. This could be because he misdiagnosed the problem with the AE-35 unit; however, it is more likely he made that error on purpose to allow him to eliminate the crew. This view accounts for more of HAL's behavior, but its detractors feel it makes unjustified assumptions.\n\nThe novel makes HAL's behavior explicit in chapter 27, \"Need to Know.\" Clarke implies that HAL equates withholding of information to lying, and hence imperfection, leading to a loss of mental stability. In the film, Kubrick only gives the viewer some odd dialogue between HAL and Dave, and HAL and Frank, plus some strange operational behavior. These are clues from which several conclusions may be drawn. It is to be noted that \"HAL's twin\" (twins in the novel) remains rational and differs with HAL. Since both viewpoints have their passionate adherents, there is no universal agreement on the question of HAL's behavior."], ["Is the movie about God?", "KUBRICK: I will say that the god concept is at the heart of 2001, but not any traditional, anthropomorphic image of god.

These beings would be gods to the billions of less advanced races in the universe, just as man would appear a god to an ant. They would be incomprehensible to us except as gods; and if the tendrils of their consciousness ever brushed men's minds, it is only the hand of god we could grasp as an explanation. Mere speculation on the possibility of their existence is sufficiently overwhelming, without trying to decipher their motives. The important point is that all the standard attributes assigned to god in our history could equally well be the characteristics of biological entities who, billions of years ago, were at a stage of development similar to man's own and evolved into something as remote from man as man is remote from the primordial ooze from which he first emerged.

That would be barely noticeable from our POV\u2014even if the change wasn't immediately corrected by an auto-pilot mechanism, which is feasible. Regardless of how Bowman exited the pod, the change in momentum of all that left the pod in one direction will be precisely balanced by the change of momentum of the pod in the opposite direction. A good baseline for calculating changes in momentum can be obtained by assuming conditions of standard temperature and pressure in the pod, a gas volume of 4 cubic metres, a mass for the pod of 2,500 kilograms (kg), a mass for Bowman of 150 kg, an average \u0394v of 200 m/s for the air in the pod, and a \u0394v of 10 m/s for Bowman\u2014all of which yields a result of 1 m/s. If the ambient pressure in the POD were lower, we don't know what it is, or Bowman could have purposely lowered it, it would have moved more slowly. During Apollo, the cabin pressures sometimes ran at one third of an atmosphere the film was made during this time. It is to be inferred that, due to reaction forces by the escaping POD cabin atmosphere plus the torque exerted by POD door transverse retraction, the POD's reaction control system has to be active during any emergency ingress. That is, the auto control of the reaction control system has been set to cancel translational and rotational motion."], ["Does Dave's pod become useless upon explosive re-entry of Dave in the Discovery?", "First, the pod door is intact, being that it retracted sideways into a track in the pod, so it could probably be restored. In _2010_ (qv), the novel, it is explained that Dave recovered that pod, fixed and put it back in the pod bay, which is the pod one sees in _2010_ (qv).

From this mythological perspective, the hotel room can be seen as a symbolic womb where the hero goes through the process of death and rebirth. This symbolic rebirth is an essential part of the hero myth. Some examples: (1) Egyptian - The dead Osiris is placed into a tree trunk and is later reborn as Horus, (2) Jewish - Jonah is spiritually reborn after spending time in the belly of a great fish, (3) Jewish - In a twist, Noah is not himself transformed in his ark, but the world around him was reborn, (4) Greek - Herakles enters a cave to travel to the underworld in order to complete his final task, from which he was given demigod status, and (5) Christian - Jesus was entombed in a cave until his resurrection fulfilling prophesy and confirming his status as a divine being."], ["How does the movie end?", "As the monolith and moons align, a psychedelic light show begins and the pod enters a wormhole. Dave sees a series of oddly-colored landscapes as if he was flying over them. The pod ends up somewhere in time and space in a bedroom with a luminous white floor and furniture in the style of Louis XVI (as in neoclassical). Dave gets out, now a trembling grey-haired man. Next door in a similarly styled bathroom, Dave looks at himself in a mirror. Back in the bedroom someone is sitting at a table eating. It's Dave again, now much older and dressed in a dark velour robe. Old Dave has a drink of wine; the glass falls to the floor and breaks. Another man lies sleeping on the bed. It is a still older Dave, who stirs and raises an arm. The black monolith appears in the center of the room. Dave is transformed into a fetus in a sac.

Could you give us your own interpretation?\n\nKUBRICK: I don't want to because I think that the power of the ending is based on the subconscious emotional reaction of the audience, which has a delayed effect. To be specific about it, certainly to be specific about what it's supposed to mean, spoils people's pleasure and denies them their own emotional reactions.\n\nEYE: Can you be general about what you intended?\n\nKUBRICK: Well, I can tell you what literally, at the lowest level of plot, happens. Bowman is drawn into a stargate. He is taken into another dimension of time and space, into the presence of godlike entities who have transcended matter and who are now creatures of pure energy. They provide an environment for him, a human zoo, if you like. They study him. His life passes before him. He sees himself age in what seems just a matter of moments, he dies, and he's reborn, transfigured, enhanced, a superbeing. I don't believe that anyone is terribly far from understanding it. What people sometimes mean is that they want some confirmation of what they've seen happen, and what they think. Some people who are used to the conventions of realistic theater and the three-act play are surprised when a new form is presented to them, no matter how intensely they react to it, and no matter how much pleasure they get from it.\n\nEYE: Bowman, after this incredible experience, winds up in an eighteenth-century French bedroom. That really flips a lot of people out. Can you tell us how you conceived of this bedroom?\n\nKUBRICK: Well, again, this gets into the area of imagination and artistic processes, whatever they are. The room is made from his own memories and dreams. It could have been anything that you could possibly imagine. This just seemed to be the most interesting room to have.

Two experienced engineers, Dr. Fred Ordway and Harry Lange of Marshall Spaceflight Center, spent three years working with Kubrick on everything from spaceship and interior design to spacesuit design. However, while Kubrick and Clarke strove for accuracy in making the movie, a number of errors have been noted. (1) When the shuttle synchronizes its rotation with the space station, the angle of the sun shining on the station does not change. (2) During the sequence where Floyd's ship to the moon is landing at Clavius, the gases at the pad swirl as they would on Earth, rather than stream out in straight-line ballistic trajectories. This became startlingly obvious only on July 20, 1969, a year after the film was released, as Apollo 11 transmitted live TV of the landing on the moon. (3) During scenes on the moon, gravity seems to be normal, instead of the one sixth g that would be prevalent. (4) When David Bowman sets off the explosive bolts to jump from the pod to the airlock, the pod should have moved away from the ship (although if the pod were particularly heavy, its movement could have been minimal). It could be argued, however, that Bowman might have set the reaction control system to compensate for the POD's motion. (5) When Bowman jumps out of the airlock, he appears to hold his breath. In reality, this is the worst thing a person can do in such a scenario."], ["Why is this film considered one of the greatest of all time?", "_2001: A Space Odyssey_ (qv) is today recognized by many critics and audiences as one of the greatest films ever made; the 2002 and 2012 Sight & Sound poll of critics ranked it among the top ten films of all time. It was nominated for four Academy Awards, and received one for visual effects. In 1991, it was deemed \"culturally, historically, and aesthetically significant\" by the United States Library of Congress and selected for preservation in their National Film Registry. The storyline deals with thematic elements of human evolution, technology, artificial intelligence, and extraterrestrial life, and is notable for its scientific realism, pioneering special effects, ambiguous and often surreal imagery, sound in place of traditional narrative techniques, and minimal use of dialogue. The movie employs music and imagery from avant-garde music and art, including the music of Ligeti, making it a very significant link between art and popular culture."], ["What kind of camera was used?", "Kubrick used a front projection camera. Besides the 1963 Japanese film Matango, it was the first time this kind of camera was used in a feature film."], ["Why is there so little dialogue?", "KUBRICK: It's not a message I ever intended to convey in words. 2001 is a nonverbal experience; out of two hours and 19 minutes of film, there are only a little less than 40 minutes of dialogue. I tried to create a visual experience, one that bypasses verbalized pigeonholing and directly penetrates the subconscious with an emotional and philosophic content. To convolute McLuhan, in 2001 the message is the medium. I intended the film to be an intensely subjective experience that reaches the viewer at an inner level of consciousness, just as music does; to explain a Beethoven symphony would be to emasculate it by erecting an artificial barrier between conception and appreciation. You're free to speculate as you wish about the philosophical and allegorical meaning of the film, and such speculation is one indication that it has succeeded in gripping the audience at a deep level, but I don't want to spell out a verbal road map for 2001 that every viewer will feel obligated to pursue or else fear he's missed the point. How much would we appreciate La Gioconda [the Mona Lisa] today if Leonardo had written at the bottom of the canvas: This lady is smiling slightly because she has rotten teeth or because she's hiding a secret from her lover? It would shut off the viewer's appreciation and shackle him to a reality other than his own. I don't want that to happen to 2001.

Both Kubrick and Arthur C. Clarke stated this was purely coincidence, and that HAL's name is an acronym for Heuristic ALgorithmic ((1) heuristic adj. 1 - allowing or assisting to discover. 2 - proceeding to a solution by trial and error. [Greek heurisko]; (2) algorithm n. process or set of rules used for calculation etc., esp. with a computer; (3) algorithmic adj. [Persian, name of a 9th-century mathematician al-Kuwarizmi]) KUBRICK:\tBy the way, just to show you how interpretation can sometimes be bewildering: A cryptographer went to see the film, and he said, \"Oh. I get it. Each letter of HAL's name is one letter ahead of IBM. The H is one letter in front of I, the A is one letter in front of B, and the L is one letter in front of M.\" Now this is a pure coincidence, because HAL's name is an acronym of heuristic and algorithmic, the two methods of computer programming...an almost inconceivable coincidence. It would have taken a cryptographer to have noticed that.\n\n(The Making of _2001: A Space Odyssey_ (qv), Eye Magazine Interview, Modern Library, pp. 249) To support the idea that this is a coincidence, there is a similar sequence: the joke that the land of OZ is between New York and Pennsylvania; the reasoning is that the same \"next letter\" motion turns \"NY\" into \"OZ\", and then \"PA\" (with a Z becoming A). However, the high-definition edition has shed doubts on Kubrick's claim. In one scene, Frank Poole says \"I can't quite put my finger on\" what's wrong with HAL, while 8 minutes before this, Dave Bowman is working a keypad with his finger just beside a panel with an IBM logo. Also, when Dave is trying to reason with HAL, he says \"Can you read me?\", while the letters \"MEM\" are projected onto his face at an angle that makes the letters look like \"IBM\"."], ["I just watched \"_2001: A Space Odyssey_ (qv)\", and I didn't really understand what was happening. How can I understand the film better?", "The most obvious answer would, of course, be to watch the film again. 2001 is a movie that is well-known for revealing new secrets upon its second, third or even one hundredth viewing! Discussing the film with peers can often prove very helpful, and it is always interesting to discover other people's personal opinions on what they've seen. Arthur C. Clarke's and Kubrick's novel, written by Clarke but in close collaboration with Kubrick (mostly between May 1964 and December 1965, and published shortly after the film's release), deals with the same subject matter in quite a straightforward manner. However, understand that despite the constant contact between Clarke and Kubrick during its gestation (see Clarke's 1972 book, \"Lost Worlds of 2001\" for his diary of the process), there is no guarantee that their visions were identical, and either may well have had further or modified thoughts as time progressed. Thus, two things appear to be true: first, that a work of such depth and complexity does not necessarily have any unique meaning; and yet, second, there is a definite philosophical and \"hard science\" back story on which it rests, so that it is not simply psychedelic flim-flam, intended as pure entertainment. Both of the creators were deeply serious. Clarke has also gone on record to say that the film intentionally raises more questions than it answers... and if anyone completely understands it, then [he and Kubrick] have failed to deliver."], ["Did Kubrick use drugs?", "He didn't use recreational drugs. (There is no evidence that he ever had.) As well, he had his reasons: PLAYBOY: Have you ever used LSD or other so-called consciousness-expanding drugs?\n\nKUBRICK: No. I believe that drugs are basically of more use to the audience than to the artist. I think that the illusion of oneness with the universe, and absorption with the significance of every object in your environment, and the pervasive aura of peace and contentment is not the ideal state for an artist. It tranquilizes the creative personality, which thrives on conflict and on the clash and ferment of ideas. The artist's transcendence must be within his own work; he should not impose any artificial barriers between himself and the mainspring of his subconscious. One of the things that's turned me against LSD is that all the people I know who use it have a peculiar inability to distinguish between things that are really interesting and stimulating and things that appear so in the state of universal bliss the drug induces on a good trip. They seem to completely lose their critical faculties and disengage themselves from some of the most stimulating areas of life. Perhaps when everything is beautiful, nothing is beautiful.

Journey also shares with the Odyssey a concern for wandering, exploration and adventure.\" Mr. Clarke agreed...space is an endless source of knowledge, which may transform our civilization in the same sense that the voyages of the Renaissance transformed the Dark Ages.

It appears Kubrick and Clarke were not making a literal adaptation of Homer's poetry, but only working along similar epic lines. In the quote by the pair, made before the film was even in production, Kubrick emphasizes this more general similarity by saying his project is only \"comparable in some ways\" to Homer. Clarke, meanwhile, seems more interested in later history, the \"voyages of the Renaissance [that] transformed the Dark Ages.\" Supporters of the Homer connection feel that, since one of Odysseus' skills was as an archer, Dave's last name of Bowman makes the connection literal. Discounting that Dave isn't an archer at all, despite his name, this tenuous link grows weaker still in light of the differences in the two characters. Homer's protagonist, after all, is a vindictive, brutal, self-serving scoundrel. And, outside surface similarities, their journeys are entirely unalike. Dave is on an outward-bound voyage of discovery, while Odysseus' only concern is getting back home. Nor do their deeds make the supposed resemblances any stronger, since these are actions found in most all epic stories. In science-fiction film, for instance, both Ripley of the Alien series and Neo from The Matrix series must rescue some of their companions, lose others to \"monsters,\" avoid spectacular hazards, survive storms, visit strange locales, have extended stays in those places, and return from them greatly changed.

Wells and Olaf Stapleton, wrote and published Childhood's End in the mid 1950s. In Clarke's logs of his collaboration, he wrote that Kubrick had once gotten very interested in using the \"devils\" idea from Childhood's End for portraying 2001's aliens. As Heywood Floyd first stroked the monolith on the moon, the idea presents itself ..... is this some kind of abstract re-interpretation of BIG THINKS about advanced alien civilizations by way of Clarke's Childhood's End? (Clarke's The Sentinel is really only a hook upon which to hang the monolith.) It appears now Kubrick was throughly familiar with modern prose science fiction and must have read Childhood's End. The ending of the film could be interpreted as a connection to Karellen/Overmind/Rashaverak of Childhood's End all super concentrated and contracted by Kubrick into the Star Child.

The novel came about after we did a 130-page prose treatment of the film at the very out-set. This initial treatment was subsequently changed in the screenplay, and the screenplay in turn was altered during the making of the film. But Arthur took all the existing material, plus an impression of some of the rushes, and wrote the novel. As a result, there's a difference between the novel and the film.

In the movie, the journey is to Jupiter. Apparently, Saturn's rings were too difficult to show realistically. (2) In the movie, HAL tries to kill Dave by keeping him out of Discovery after Dave retrieves Frank's body. In the book, Dave never tries to retrieve Frank's body, and HAL tries to kill him by opening inside and outside airlock doors and letting all air escape. In both cases, Dave survives by making it to an emergency airlock and turning on the oxygen. (3) In the book, HAL was first activated in 1997. In the movie, the year is said to be 1992.

If it gets cold while you're sleeping, sometimes people dream of ice or snow. If a person falls out of bed, sometimes they'll dream of skydiving or falling in their dream. So when the van in the dream level above the hotel falls off the bridge, the equilibrium of those inside the van is thrown off, and that feeling of falling carries over into the dream, making it as though there's no gravity in the hotel level below the van. This effect does not, however, seem to extend any further than one level in a dream within a dream within a dream. Another theory might be that both Arthur & Eames aren't affected equally: While Arthur and his dream world are easily affected by the loss of gravity, Eames is much more immune to such influences, or he's actually well trained himself as he must keep his environment as controlled as possible when he f.ex. needs to portray as other persons. There seems to be some effect of Yusuf driving through the barrier (& the loss of gravity in the hotel) inside Eames' dream, however, when team's surprised by the sudden avalanche. Eames suggests that the effect of events is weakened when propagating through multiple dream levels.

This is supposed to happen before the van plows through the barrier and off the bridge. However, the timing is thrown off and now that Arthur's body is in free-fall in the van, it translates into his dream of the hotel - thus preventing the floor from dropping once the explosives discharge. He improvises a kick by moving everyone into the lift and then setting off an explosive to cause the lift to start moving up the shaft (this works much like a rocket on a space craft). To those in the lift, the force of the lift pushing them is equivalent to gravity. Gravity alone is not enough to awaken the dreamers, but when the lift hits the roof at the top of the shaft, the sudden stopping or slowing-down causes the dreamers to first be propelled upwards, and then fall back to the floor. The result is the same as the inner ear only detects the acceleration due to a force acting on the body, much like Eames' demonstration of tipping Arthur's chair over to wake him up."], ["After he's shot and killed, they resuscitate Fischer Jr. Why couldn't they save Saito in the same way?", "Saito is shot on the first level of the dream, but dies on the third level and enters limbo minutes before Ariadne leaves Limbo.

In the end, he still goes back to Limbo. Meanwhile, since Fischer was shot on the third level and sent to Limbo, his \"bodies\" on the other two levels were totally fine. Ariadne pushed him off the building in Limbo (level 4) to provide him a \"kick\" in conjunction with Eames using the defibrillator in level 3 to bring Fischer back to life in order to complete the mission.

Why are Cobb's projections of his wife and kids there?", "Limbo is an infinite dream place of shared subconsciousness. It only contains things you've built in it or what you intended there to be, which could explain why limbo has so few projections. When you're there too long, the mind starts to think its real.

It's only when we wake up that we realize something was actually strange.\" (The machine allows you to share dream space with others, but since only Cobb and Mal been to there, so the place is filled with things created by both of them. Ariadne is new, so there's none of her projections in there.) The projection of his wife is something he tells Mal at the end that he's tried to recreate over time (by storing memories of her in his mind), so they could still be together in dreams. Therefore, it could be that she's actually an intentional creation of his, out of love and guilt. Similarly, Saito could have created the guards which populate his limbo. Saito has spent many years being a powerful businessman and would be used to having security of some form or another around him. Cobb's children are always on his mind, just like Mal, but by the time he is in limbo at the beginning/end he has cleared his mind of Mal, but not his children.

This is why it is so dangerous and feared by the team. The reason it was filled with Cobb and Mal's city was because Cobb had spent 50 years there. As with other dream levels, each state of dreaming is filled with projections and places from each of the current dreamers minds. Having spent so much time there, Cobb filled limbo with his dream-memories of his and Mal's previous limbo city. After Mal dies in their apartment, Cobb wakes up on the beach once again. This time, near a pagoda-like palace where he finds Old Saito. The jump from one place to another can be explained by a previous scene in the movie where Cobb tells Ariadne that often in dreams you jump from one place to another, not knowing how you got there. Alternatively, the jump can also be explained by Cobb drowning to his death in the first level of dream thus ending up in limbo. The reason the palace is here in this part of limbo is because Saito and Cobb had spent time there during the audition Extraction that Cobb and his previous team did for Saito. Saito now occupies this palace in limbo where he has been stuck for many years."], ["Why is Saito so much older than Cobb in limbo?", "One theory is that Cobb entered limbo twice. The first time was with Ariadne. They found Fischer and kicked him back to Eames' dream. Meanwhile Saito dies and goes to limbo. Cobb provokes Mal into attacking him. (NOTE - he provoked her very methodically. This was a conscious choice he made for some reason and this theory is one explanation for it.) Mal dies from Ariadne's gunshot wound and Cobb dies from Mal's knife wound. At this point, Cobb is currently dying in all 3 levels (in 3: crushed by the exploding snow fortress, in 2: in the crashing elevator, in 1: left to drown in the van.) When he dies in limbo, he wakes up in one of (all of?) these levels and dies again, sending him to limbo and washing up on the shore near Saito's palace. Saito, having been in limbo this whole time, has aged decades while Cobb is just arriving to limbo for the 2nd time. A second perspective as to why Saito is older, is that limbo is formed around the \"raw subconscious.\" During the helicopter scene, Saito relates to Cobb his personal fear of becoming an old man filled with regret. And this is the form that Saito takes in his limbo. His age does not reflect the time in the various levels of dreams. With this in mind, the flashbacks of Cobb and Mal in their old age perhaps did not reflect them becoming old in limbo, rather it was real memories of themselves."], ["Why is the limbo at the end of the film filled with Cobb and Mal's city?", "Limbo is a shared environment not limited to a single subconscious. It is referred to earlier in the film as \"unconstructed dream space\". It is filled with Cobb's decaying city because he is the only one in the group who has experienced limbo before. Had Cobb not spent 50 years there, it would have supposedly been empty space. A second theory is the city is the remains of what Cobb and Mal had created. When Saito died from the gun shot wound, he entered the limbo in which Cobb and Mal had been.\nSome say that it is not Limbo, and that it is Cobb's dream (for how can Cobb and Ariadne purposely put themselves in Limbo). A point to refute this is that Fischer was in it, but maybe he was just a projection. Mal is a projection, why couldn't Fischer?"], ["While entering a new dream level, how do the characters in the shared dream know they're in a dream? How do they know what they are supposed to do?", "Cobb says at one point that remembering what happened in a dream takes years of experience. It can be assumed that this also works conversely: remembering what happened in reality when entering a dream. It is made apparent throughout the film that the dreamers are fully aware of what they're doing because they've trained ahead of time. Many of the \"why\"s in the film can be explained simply because the dreamers are professionals and have training & experience. Imagine, if you will, that you could predict what dream you were going to have tonight and you could prepare for it, when you arrived in the dream you would be aware what it was because you have prepared yourself for it. Throughout the film Cobb's team prepares thoroughly for the _Inception_ (qv) job; they study Ariadne's models (with the exception of Cobb), they go through the scenarios, etc. By the time they are actually ready to enter the dreams, they have fully prepared their minds for what they're about to experience and their minds can thus recognize the reality that they are in a dream while Fischer, on the other hand, has not had any prior knowledge of this and can thus be fooled by the illusion."], ["What significance did the numbers on the piece of paper that Eames gives Fischer Jr. have?", "These numbers (\"528491\") were the same ones that Fischer Jr. randomly came up with for the team when he was being held hostage. Just as a safe created by an architect can be filled with a dreamer's secrets, so too can the safe be set to unlock with the dreamer's own numbers. By taking Fischer Jr. to a second dream level, his subconscious is able to interpret a string of numbers that was \"random\" on the first as being significant on the second and finally the actual combination on the third. Eames (projected as a blonde woman) gives Fischer Jr. the numbers so that he can have further rehearsal with them and internalize them further. Cobb exploits this and forces additional rehearsal when he asks Fischer to \"figure out the room\" to search for extractors. The rest of his team is already at the hotel room when Cobb and Fischer arrive, since they knew the room to be at since they exited the first dream."], ["Where did the quote \"Death and nature illuminate, elevate. Love ventures under, the rest all never\" come from in one of the interviews of the movie?", "Nolan has said multiple times that one of his favorite quotes that have inspired him to make this movie is just that. In many other interviews he says that although this is a completely original idea, there are causes of inspiration for everything he's done. This explains the whole premise of \"inception\" and is a big symbol of how our lives are all made up of tiny little inceptions (or inspirations) caused by others."], ["What is the significance of the song \"Non, Je Ne Regrette Rien?\"", "\"Non, Je Ne Regrette Rien\" is the signature song of the French songstress '\u00c9dith Piaf' (qv) (1915-1963). The song was written for Piaf in 1956 by Charles Dumont and Michel Vaucaire and recorded by Piaf in 1960. It appears in her biography film _La m\u00f4me (2007)_ (qv) (retitled La Vie en Rose for English-language release) and its title translates into English as \"No, I regret nothing.\" In _Inception_ (qv), \"Non, Je Ne Regrette Rien\" is used to signal the various characters that it is time to wake up and/or \"kick up\" into a higher dream level. It's an appropriate song for _Inception_ (qv) because of the theme of regret that weaves through the film. According to the Wall Street Journal, Christopher Nolan, the writer and director of _Inception_ (qv), had incorporated the use of this song into the script from early on. 'Marion Cotillard' (qv), who plays Mal, also portrayed Piaf in La Vie en Rose (and won an Academy Award for it), which caused Nolan to seriously consider taking the song out before convinced by Hans Zimmer to keep it. The melody of \"Non, Je Ne Regrette Rien\" is also echoed in the score of _Inception_ (qv) by being slowed down."], ["Was the end a dream or reality?", "Although no one can prove it one way or another, unless that person is Chris Nolan, it is hard to say. Both theories are possible.\n\nEvidence to Reality: If we accept that the entire movie is not a dream, and that Cobb did in fact escape his limbo with Mal, then it is reasonable to believe he also escaped his limbo with Saito. Also, there are simple explanations as to why when he sees his kids again they look much like they did in his dream. For example, he never saw his kids faces so we cannot easily tell if they had aged much from his memory. In addition, the movie never defines the amount of time that has passed since Mal had died and Cobb was banned from the U.S. So the memory of his kids may only be a few months old, therefore it is very possible his kids look pretty much the same in the memories and in the present. In addition, the visual duration of the top spinning is never a trustworthy totem at all, since it is a property of the totem others can observe and recreate. If the top is to be trustworthy at all, it is Cobb's knowledge of how it feels to spin it that convinces him he is awake, not the duration of the spinning, which we can presume will end eventually in the final scene. Visually, there is an obvious difference between the wobbly spinning in the end-scene and the absolutely perfect spin in the safe during limbo, again implying the possibility that the final spin could be natural (though only the feel in Cobb's fingers would know for sure). It is alleged that at the end of the film Cobb's children are wearing different, albeit similar clothing compared to the clothes they wear in Cobb's subconscious. In the opening scene dream, you get a glimpse of Cobb's hand. He's wearing his wedding ring. Now, if you follow the rest of the movie keeping an eye out for this you will notice that he only has the ring on when he's allegedly in a dream. At the end of the movie he isn't wearing the ring. If the ring only appears when he's in a dream and he's not wearing at the end of the film, that could be confirmation that in fact he woke up. The sound of the top falling over is played after the credits indicating that it is indeed \"reality\", but the important part is that Cobb is not looking at it, because as Nolan says \"He doesnt care.\n\nEvidence to Dream: It is possible that the entire movie is a dream, and that Cobb never left his own limbo. The children appear the same age as in a previous memory, and in fact, appear to have the same motions and same clothes in the yard before turning around. It suggests to the viewer that this is exactly the same as his memory, and thus he could be still dreaming. How long the top spins is not a good totem, except in that it spinning forever is only possible in the dream world. A short-duration spin is a visual property that someone could easily recreate in a dream. If we trust the spinning top, it must be the exact feel in Cobb's fingers as he spins it that convinces him it is genuine. However, Cobb admits that the totem was originally Mal's totem, suggesting that he adopted it as his totem during limbo, making it impossible for him to know the true feel. In addition, a totem can not prove that you've woken up from your own dream, since you know it's true 'feel' and thus your subconscious can recreate it properly.[/spoiler]\n\nAlso: This may be a continutity error, but when Arthur comes to get Cobb in Tokyo, they leave the hotel room and go to the roof for the helicopter at night. When they're on the roof, it's day.\n\n\"Both theories are true\" theory: Movie has two main themes: the first one is that the line between dreams and reality can be imperceptible from the perspective of an individual; the second that an idea can be a parasite which, once incepted, can take over one's psyche. The ending simply reflects the fact that the idea that killed Mal has now taken over Cobb; he cannot discern whether he is now living in a dream or a reality, and we, the audience, witness that intimately. The gyro in the end falters, but we do not see whether it stops or not. Have we witnessed it stop, the movie would be essentially telling us \"fear not, this is real and a happy end\". Had the shot ended with it spinning, the movie would affirm the other theory. However, the shot as-is wants to ensure us that we do not know and we cannot know, because Cobb doesn't know anymore. The lack of definite answer IS the answer; for the rest of his life Cobb will wonder whether everything around him is real, and the audience is deliberately left with that same question hanging in their heads. Notice that when Cobb is in his \"Memory bank\" with Ariadne, Cobb is looking out the window at his kids, he tells Ariadne that his greatest regret is not being able to alter this moment and see his children's beautiful faces again. That would imply that was Cobb's inception to himself. He finally did what he could never do before and altered the moment in which he saw his children and he sees their faces. Also, why was Miles there? He was living in France yet was waiting at the airport in the States (reason why MIles was there: When Cobb visitied Miles it was to give him a gift for his children. i.e. Miles was traveling to see Cobb's children in the near future, and obviously Cobb could and would have made arrangements with Miles when he knew he was coming back to America). Even more confusing, Miles' wife, Mal's mother was taking care of Cobb's children in America yet we never see her at the house at the end . The inception itself could be altering his biggest regrets which spreads to every aspect of his life he winds up needing to alter. Or Mal was right the whole time and he was actually still down one dream level and Mal is alive in reality and Cobb wasn't waking up.\n\nThe Spiritual / Metaphysical explanation: From a spiritual perspective there is a different reading again. This movie is one with a profound spiritual idea at its heart, for those interested - just as with 'The Matrix', and Guy Ritchie's 'Revolver'. In '_Inception_ (qv)', Nolan seems to be using the metaphysics given in 'A Course In Miracles', a seminal spiritual text from the 1970s that was purportedly channelled from Jesus and which continues to profoundly influence modern spiritual thinking. In ACIM the key idea is that what we think of as reality is in fact a dream - that there is no difference between the dreams we see at night, and what we see with our eyes open. Both are projections of our mind, which is trying to escape a core guilt by projecting guilt outside of itself onto projected 'dream figures'. [spoiler](For more on this see the FAQ titled 'If the spinning top really did keep spinning at the end...'). Thus, although Cobb returned to 'reality', Nolan seems to be making the point that what we think of as 'reality' is still a dream. And, that within that dream, we see what we want to see - projection makes perception. Thus, the movie is devised so that some viewers look at the spinning top and see it as being about to fall over as the movie ends. They decide that the movie is saying that Cobb is back in 'reality' and not dreaming. Others see the top as going to continue spinning indefinitely. But, one then inevitably asks, how could Cobb be still in a dream? Which leads us to think hard, to debate, to share ideas, and perhaps eventually to question the unquestionable - that 'reality' is not what it seems to be. Nolan is cleverly sowing a key idea in our consciousness. So you could say the movie _Inception_ (qv) is in itself... an inception! Within this interpretative framework, Nolan is reaching to us within the 'dream' that we call reality to help us to start to challenge our assumptions about 'reality' and begin to wake up - just as Cobb went into limbo to get Saito.\n\nYet for an inception to work, one must accept it as one's own thought process... so of course Nolan does not give interviews where he says, 'This is a movie where I'm trying to wake people up to the fact that they're dreaming'."], ["What is the significance of the name \"Ariadne\"?", "In Greek Mythology she was considered the \"Mistress of the Labyrinth.\"\nIn the legend of Theseus and the Minotaur, Ariadne () was a princess of Crete and her father (the king) created a labyrinth with a minotaur inside it. Every year seven men and seven women would have to be sacrificed to it. One year a hero named Theseus offered to kill the minotaur and Ariadne fell in love with him so she gave him a ball of string before he entered the labyrinth as well as directions. Theseus was able to kill the minotaur and took Ariadne for his bride. In some accounts of the myth, Theseus later abandoned Ariadne on the island of Naxos, where she was discovered and rescued by the god Dionysus. Ariadne eventually became the wife of Dionysus and joined the pantheon of gods on Mount Olympus. This song can also be read as backing the theory that '_Inception_ (qv)' follows the metaphysics of A Course in Miracles, a spiritual text which describes humanity as dreaming. The dream is described in the Course as having a flavour or underlying, all-pervasive guilt - just as Cobb tells Adriadne he experiences. Truth, says ACIM, is buried deep in the dreamer's unconscious mind (cf Mal's safe), and Spirit tries to wake us up to our innocence through what is metaphorically described as 'an ancient melody' that speaks of our innocence - (cf 'Je ne regrette rien' as the call to wake up throughout the movie). Cobb is told by Ariadne that the key to him undoing the nightmarish situation in which he is entrapped with Mal is forgiveness. And so 'Mal' ('bad / evil' in French and Spanish) is undone by Forgiveness. Cobb forgives both Mal and himself, releases his regrets, and so heals his past (another key theme of ACIM). Thus in the movie, Ariadne serves as the 'mistress of the labyrinth' both in the obvious sense of devising dream labyrinthine architecture, and in the more subtle sense of leading Cobb out of his mental imprisonment."], ["What were the dream layers in order?", "1.

When Cobb reminds Mal that they did grow old together, and we see them as they really were in his memory, walking together as older people, finally we see their aged hands clasped together, shaking as they lay by the train tracks.

The device used to enter dreams connects to the wrist of the people using it, but it does not appear to be intravenous (IV). Specifically, there is never any evidence of puncture marks, blood spots, or gauze/bandages. After Saito wakes from his dream on the train, he feels his wrist, which shows no evidence of needle puncture, etc. The machine is a plot device that somehow allows the experience of shared subconscious during dreaming, and it also apparently rapidly induces REM sleep (the phase of sleep in which dreaming takes place). It also maintains this REM state for the duration of its activation, obviously necessary for the extraction missions. The science or mechanism behind these features of the machine are not explained, presumably as they have nothing to do with the actual plot. An example of a plausible explanation may involve the use of electromagnetic pulses to stimulate rapid onset of REM, but this is pure speculation."], ["How did Cobb and Mal enter limbo?", "Cobb says that he and Mal were exploring the theory of a dream-within-a-dream. He wanted to go deeper and deeper and they ended up getting lost in limbo. It is also implied that the more layers deep you go, the more unstable the dreams become. And that 3-layers deep is needed for inception (3-layers+ is rarely, if ever, done.) Knowing all these facts stated clearly throughout the film, it can be assumed that anything over 3-layers deep could potentially send the dreamer to limbo. Apparently this is what happened to Cobb and Mal."], ["Was the decaying city limbo or was it Cobb's dream?", "There are 2 main theories: (1) Limbo: When Fischer and Saito died in Eames' dream (the snow fortress), they both went to limbo. If the decaying city was Cobb's dream, Fischer would not have been there. Therefore both the decaying city and Saito's palace had to have been limbo. Limbo looks like it's Cobb's dream because it was made by Cobb and Mal when they were in limbo. Otherwise limbo is an empty dream space. (2) Cobb's Dream: When Fischer died in Eames' dream, Ariadne proposes that there is a different way. She and Cobb go into yet another level of dream. When she finds Fischer and hears the signal in this dream, she throws him off the ledge. This is synched up with Eames using the defibrillator, reviving Fischer and allowing him to complete his realization of the inception. The problem with this second theory is that why and how Fisher would be in that dream with Cobb and Ariadne? He wasn't even hooked to the dream machine to share it. Plus, the conversation there between Cobb, Ariadne and Mal as well as Cobb's willingness \"to stay behind\" to find Saito, suggest that they are, in fact, in Limbo."], ["Why didn't Arthur wake up from the first kick when the van drove off the bridge?", "Due to the sedative, a synchronized multi-level kick was needed (the van freefalling, the original plan for the hotel floor explosion, and the snow fortress explosion.) Yusuf's kick (van freefall) was too early due to Fischer's projections attacking, and thus, the kicks weren't synchronized. This was designed to ensure that the team was able to stay where they needed to and finish the job. If one kick failed because it wasn't synchronized, they could try another while using the musical countdown to warn the next level that it was coming. Earlier in the movie Arthur tells Ariadne that if Yusuf kicks too early (ie, if he drives the van off the bridge before Arthur has a chance to kick the group out of Eames' dream), they won't wake up. While normally in order to wake up you must receive a kick in the level above, this isn't true when using the special sedative. Instead with the sedative it takes two or more synchronized kicks in all levels simultaneously. Arthur didn't have the second kick ready when the van drove off the bridge, so he wasn't awakened by the van falling off the bridge. When the elevator hit the ground floor and the group was kicked by the freefall, they were pulled out of Eames' dream (the snow fortress) and simultaneously pulled back into Yusuf's dream (the van). Cobb and Saito weren't kicked back up because they were still stuck in limbo and weren't being kicked at that moment. So they were left in the van underwater still attached to the dreaming device."], ["How did Cobb and Saito manage to get back to reality (in the plane)?", "Cobb explains that he and Mal escaped Limbo the first time by killing themselves, which is a normal way to wake up from a dream under regular sedation. It was explained that dying while under Yusuf's special heavy sedative would not cause you to wake up, but instead to drop down to Limbo. Once there, it would not be possible to escape by dying until the sedatives have worn off - supposedly dying would simply cause you to re-enter Limbo. The inception mission was planned for them to be sedated for about 10 hours in reality, which is about the full duration of the flight. The danger of Limbo was that those 10 hours in the real world would feel like decades in Limbo, so one could easily forget that they were dreaming and not realize that they should try to wake up. Even after the sedatives wore off, if they did not intentionally kill themselves to wake up their mind would be stuck in Limbo, and they'd be in a coma in the real world. When Cobb finds Saito in Limbo at the end, it is implied that they shoot themselves to attempt to wake up. When they wake, the flight is almost over and the dream machine is put away. This indicates that the 10 hours had passed and the sedative had run its course, so dying in Limbo woke them up like normal."], ["What happens if you die in limbo before the sedative wears off?", "For normal sedatives, you just go back to reality if you become aware that you are in limbo.

If the timer on the machine reaches zero and you've forgotten where you really are, you accept it as reality (become older like Saito and die). You'll never go back to reality as your mind perceives that you're dead (coma). Evidence: Cobb repeats what Saito had said at the start of the film: \"Someone from my half remembered dream.\" This means the two scenes in the palace are different and Saito died and back in Limbo again and again... Cobb: \"I've come back for you. To remind you something...Something you once knew...\" This means that Cobb's awareness that he's in Limbo becomes vague.

Here she shows a more sinister side: if he doesn't join her in jumping off the ledge willingly out of love for her, she has made it so he might be pressured to jump unwillingly to avoid being framed for her murder. And, in fact, it is because he doesn't jump that he ends up framed for her murder, which would motivate Cobb to follow after Mal and commit suicide to avoid a life sentence. So she was hedging her bets, so in every scenario he would wind up dying to join her in what she believed would be the real world.

This is due to the unforeseen circumstances such as Fischer's subconscious being trained (heavily armed and capable of finding the intruders quickly) and Saito is hurt and dying, so their mission needs to be completed as quickly as possible."], ["Was Ariadne somehow aware of the numbers Fischer would come up with or did she change the hotel's floor plan so that 491 would be below 528?", "The team knew the number beforehand, when Fischer told them. Since Arthur is the Dreamer, all he needs to do is to change the room number(s)."], ["How does one wake up from limbo?", "Most importantly, the person needs to be fully aware that he's in limbo. Under heavy sedation and with the time machine still in countdown, one needs to produce 2 synchronized kicks to return the level above or needs to synchronize the Kick that person performs in Limbo with all kicks on the level above to level 1 dream, then return to reality. Under normal sedation, just by killing themselves or performing a Kick on each level would do (doesn't need to be synchronized since a slight disturbance can cause dreams to collapse)."], ["What did Cobb putting a spinning top inside the safe mean?", "The safe is a creation of the subconscious that Cobb exploits, in this case Mal. The safes are constructed so that the Target believes that it is a safe place for them to store their secrets. The top is Mal's totem, which she uses to determine whether she's in a dream. If it never stops spinning, it tells Mal that she's in a dream. By placing a constantly spinning totem in the safe, Cobb is placing a very simple idea (The world is not real) inside her subconscious. It's not that she saw the totem spinning, but that it was always spinning in her subconscious mind. This is why she thought she was trapped in the dream world."], ["What is the evidence that show the whole film is a dream?", "The evidence is generally very weak in demonstrating that the \"reality\" present in the film is any different than the reality that we experience every day.\n\n1. Repeated lines of dialog shared amongst the characters: Mal and Saito both tell Cobb to take a \"leap of faith\", and Cobb predicts what Saito will say in limbo. [However, coincidental and repeated lines are common in countless films without any reason to believe they are \"all a dream.\" Additionally, the term \"take a leap of faith\" would be basically ubiquitous in a world where one must actually kill themselves just to wake up from a dream.]\n\n4. The clumsiness of the homicide police investigation regarding Mal's case and put the blame on Cobb entirely.\n[we don't know all the circumstances surrounding the investigation, and bad investigations happen all the time, so this is hardly evidence for the whole film being a dream]\n\n5. The spinning top at the end of the film. The top is a totem used to help verify whether Cobb's in reality or in someone else's dream, but it offers no verification against being in his own dream. He knows the exact weight, composition and how it should spin. So whether the top stops or continue spinning, it's not important as even when it stops, it could be that Cobb believes that he finally reunite with his family, hence his dream fully becomes his reality.\n[it's true that if the whole film is a dream, the top wouldn't matter, but this is not evidence for the film being a dream. You could say that about any behavior of any object in the whole movie]\n\n6. In Mombasa, in the bathroom after he tests Yusuf's sedative, you see the figure of Mal behind the curtains, if he was in \"reality\" then his subconscious could not be projecting her.\n[Not projections. These were just memories. The curtains were not in Yusuf's bathroom - they are the same curtains as in the hotel room.]\n\n7. Cobb's totem was not Mal's top, rather one could suggest that Mal was his reality check, his 'real' totem. Yet throughout the movie he was directly or indirectly responsible for either killing her or imprisoning her, in essence losing his sense of reality and refusing to face up to the facts - which may be that he was indeed dreaming the whole time.\n[Cobb's totem was Mal's top. In no way was Mal his reality check - it is quite the opposite.]\n\n8. The musical score that is heard, is the slowed down playhead of \"Non, Je Ne Regrette Rien\", which is the Edith Piaf song used for the musical countdown. The significance here is that the deeper you go into the dream, time slows, thus the music will slow too, mimicking the score. This musical design perhaps indicates that Cobb's reality was still very much a dream state too.\n[the music only slows down when listened to from a lower level, due to the time dilation at that level. Yes, the song was integrated into the score, but only as a theme.] [how do you know? maybe the original poster is right)\n\n9. Numerous improbable or coincidental events that happened during parts of \"reality\". Cobb is saved by Saito coincidentally during the chase between Cobol Engineering agents and him.\n[Saito has been tailing Cobb to protect his investment - not coincidental at all.]\n\n10. Nearly the entire team is highly proficient with all types of weaponry, though certainly Cobb at least, does not appear to have had any particularized weapons training. How does Ariadne know how to even fire a gun, much less hit anything? All appear to be highly capable in all sorts of militaristic tasks, from skiing, to explosives, to hand to hand combat, to sniping... [They are in a dream world during all scenes involving weapon use. Their real world weapon abilities would have no effect here. Like Eames was saying on level 1 'You need to learn to dream bigger' and then produces a grenade launcher. During the dream state, they have limited control over the experience, similar to the Matrix.]\n\n11. This may be a continuity error, but when Arthur collegoes to get Cobb in Tokyo after the failed extraction of Saito, they leave the hotel room and go to the roof for the helicopter at night. When they're on the roof, it's day.\n\n11. This may be a continuity error, but when Arthur collegoes to get Cobb in Tokyo after the failed extraction of Saito, they leave the hotel room and go to the roof for the helicopter at night. When they're on the roof, it's day.\n\nMore counter-evidence:\n1. The children are two years older in the last scene (see cast list).\n\n2. The spinning top starts to wobble just as the movie ends, and also is heard to topple and scoot across the table after it cuts to black.\n\nAlternatively,' the whole film is a dream' in the sense that Nolan is suggesting that what we think of as a waking state, or 'reality', is in fact just more dreaming (which is not supported by any interviews with Nolan or statements by the cast/crew anywhere).\n\nHinduism and Buddhism both share the idea that the world is 'maya', or an illusion and that we are on a journey of 'awakening from the dream'. This has been taught by such Indian saints as Sri Ramana Maharishi and Maharishi Mahesh Yogi, who call it 'Advaida', which means non-duality; the idea that all the universe is just one consciousness, connecting everything in it. We act out our lives like a play shown onto a movie screen. But only those who achieve Nirvana (a.k.a enlightenment, or becoming one with Nature) can perceive the illusion for what it is (a dream) and become aware of the 'screen' on which the great drama is unfolding.\n\nAccording to the Advaida philosophy, it is only when we are in a state of deep sleep that we come close to the timeless, 'true' state of being that is the universal consciousness, which all Nature is part of. When we wake up, in effect we are waking into a world that is illusory.\n\nA separate movement believes in the specific idea that humanity is collectively dreaming a dream of guilt and separation, from which we need to wake up by practising forgiveness. This is a metaphysic ideology given in A Course in Miracles and The Way of Mastery, which are spiritual texts purportedly channelled from Jesus in the 1970s and 1990s respectively. ACIM in particular has influenced most spiritual 'new age' authors and commentators today."], ["What are the evidences that show Reality exists during the film and Cobb is in reality at the end of the film?", "1. The wedding ring on Cobb's hand that's present in dreams but absent in the real world.\n\n[To refute: This could be because in what Cobb sees as a dream, he wants Mal to still be alive and married to him (keeps her alive in his memories), but in so-called reality, Cobb knows he's not married anymore and took it off. It may, in fact, be his totem, so if Cobb took it off long ago he would *not* know that he wasn't in reality. While mourning his wife I doubt he would consciously check the weight. If \"reality\" is *his* dream, which Mal says in an argument while alive, his subconscious would recreate the weight anyway; totems only tell you when you're in someone else's head unless you know you're dreaming.]\n\n2. Cobb's kids, Phillipa & James. The kids at the end of the film are different and are older compared to the younger ones we've seen throughout the film. Their clothes are slightly different. The girl has a white shirt underneath her red dress and his son was wearing shoes instead of sandals at the end. This is the most solid evidence. Observe carefully. Also if he was dreaming, he would not be able to know what his children's faces would have looked like turning around and seeing him seeing as how he cannot change a memory. He even said himself earlier in the film that no matter how hard he tried, he, \"can't change this moment.\" He will never see his children's faces unless he gets back to them.\n\n3. The top. There's a significant difference between the top that keeps spinning flawlessly when he's in a dream and the top that's spinning at the end of the film (it clearly wobbles, loses momentum and does sound like it is stopping.) [It does wobble and lose momentum, strong signs, but to me it sounded not like it toppled but that the sound for the top cut out. I re-watched the movie yesterday.] But Totems tell you when you are not in your own dream, so maybe it stopped spinning because it is his dream (?) (No, It only tells you that you are dreaming, it has no specificity to who's dream it is.) (It doesn't tell you *whose* dream you're in, but it only tells you whether or not you're in someone's dream other than your own. Another dreamer does not know the nature or behavior of your totem, which is why they are so careful to not allow someone to touch their totem. Once someone understands the nature of your totem, they can reconstruct it in their dream. You, on the other hand, *would* know the nature of your totem, so it would not work inside your own dream for the same reason - your subconscious would have no trouble reconstructing the totem's true behavior. Mal's top adds another layer of unreliability to determining whether the end is reality or dream - *everyone* knows the nature of Mal's spinning top, not to mention it does not take any special knowledge to cause a spinning top to fall over in your dream... that's what tops do.)\n\n4. It is showed at the end that Cobb and Mal did grow old together for 50 years in Limbo with them walking the streets as old man and woman, two old hands hold together on the train tracks.\n\n5. The rules, technical aspects of performing the Extraction and _Inception_ (qv) in the film.\n\n6. Cobb remembers exactly how he got to where he is, which he wouldn't know if he was dreaming. [Oh? Where was the car ride from the airport to home? Did he even think to try to remember? Not that I believe that he was dreaming, but it isn't explicitly stated.]\n\n7. The emotional depth of the film. If the ending is real, it shows that Cobb does go on an emotional journey, to take a 'leap of faith' to believe that Saito will honor their agreement so he could go home and see his kids and finally get over with his wife's death and guilt. The scene where Cobb talks with old Saito is significant as it shows they've grown and become friends, as Cobb had said to him: \"Come back and let's be young men together.\" He's 'transformed' because of his leap of faith and he's rewarded by finally reuniting with his kids. [This is hardly evidence to support it was reality, even if I agree that it was. The important part to the ending is that it doesn't actually matter if the top fell or not- if it's reality or not. The character arc you are talking about could have happened with or without reality and in the end Cobb gets what he wants/needs. That is the resolution.]\n\n8. Cobb and Mal do not end up together. This could only be a factor of reality. If it were a dream, Cobb would have found a way of keeping Mal alive in the dream so that he could be with her. [*Very* solid evidence.] (Cobb wouldn't want to do this because he states that his recreation of her in his dreams \"isn't good enough\" because it doesn't truly capture what she was in real life, with all her perfection and flaws.)\n\n9. Throughout the shooting script Nolan uses the simple transitional element for changing scenes, \"and we-- CUT TO:\" every time this occurs it's not cutting to another scene with in the 'present' reality, but it 'cuts to' either a higher or lower dream within the dream, or it 'cuts to' reality. So at the end of the shooting script Nolan writes \"And we-- FADE OUT.\" By Nolan saying that it doesn't 'cut to' another level of the dream, or back to reality, but instead it simply 'fades out,' Nolan is letting us, the viewer, know that after reality there is nothing to 'cut to,' so Cobb is presently in reality. Nolan allows the viewer to make his/her own assumptions based upon their optimistic/pessimistic worldview, but Nolan's in one of optimism, as can be seen in all his other films. He's not a 'happy ending' director, but he's optimistic about the future... [All scripts start with Fade In and end with Fade Out...]\n\nAlternatively, Nolan is showing that what we commonly believe to be reality exists during the film, and that Cobb is indeed in what we'd call 'reality' at the end of the film. BUT, the spinning top is a clue from him - an inception to us, the audience - that our idea of 'reality' may in itself be the projection of a dreaming mind.... that collectively, we are all dreaming an outpictured 'reality' full of projected figures."], ["What is the music used in the trailers?", "In the teaser trailer, the music used is a custom score from Sencit Music, composed by Mike Zarin (website here). The second trailer uses a variation of the same song. The longer theatrical trailer uses a track titled \"Mind Heist\", composed by 'Zack Hemsey' (qv) (website here). Contrary to popular belief, the music was not composed by Hans Zimmer, who composed the actual score for the film."], ["Does Cobb ever wake up?", "The evidence strongly suggests that he did. Multiple cast members who worked with Christopher Nolan directly and heard his whole vision of the movie probably ad nauseum, including Michael Caine explicitly, and Dileep Rao implicitly, confirm that the ending is part of reality. The top is heard strongly wobbling, about to tip as the screen cuts to black. Upon the completion of a successful mission with the team, one could either believe that Cobb was able to save Saito and himself from Limbo, reuniting him with his family in reality, or we can believe that he was stuck forever and ever more in his Limbo and had only imagined him saving Saito and reuniting with his family. The latter theory, however, does not match with any characteristics of Limbo presented in the movie. In order for the final scenes with Cobb to be Limbo, he (who knows that Limbo is not real) would have to build an airplane, recreate all his team members, create and populate the entire city of Los Angeles, and then create his children two years older. And also create a Limbo where tops wobble instead of spinning perfectly. Then, he would have to forget it was Limbo and \"wake up\" on the plane he created."], ["Where was dream level 3rd (the snow fort) filmed?", "Near Calgary, Canada. The crew constructed the buildings in the third layer on the site of a former ski resort. The real-life inspiration for the fort, however, can be seen in San Diego, California: it's the UCSD Geisel Library."], ["What year does this film take place?", "The film doesn't say, but from earlier statements, Chris Nolan declared that the film is supposed to be contemporary."], ["Are the children the same age in the end scene as in any prior memory?", "To many, the children appear to not have aged in the end scene. IMDb cast credits show that two pairs of children were cast for the two different ages (about two years apart). There are multiple memories, some of which show the younger children playing at the beach, others show the younger children playing in the yard throughout the film. The younger children also appear run around a corner leading Cobb to Mal in the final limbo. Certainly the children appear to be a similar age, and to be wearing similar clothing. Repeat analysis shows that the clothing is similar at the end, though not the same. The children do look older. However, considering the power of the dreamer to alter the world of the dream, this is no guarantee that the children, if indeed they are projections, haven't just been changed by Cobb so that he will accept them as real. Certainly the story is very clever in creating this ambiguity. Cobb is unable to see their faces in his memory of the yard to confirm they look younger (the body shows they are smaller). Other theories have suggested that the reason for casting two sets of child actors were to have one set visible, while the other set only heard. The voices of the children on the phone seem older than what would belong to the children playing."], ["Why is Fischer Jr. unsuspicious about the appearance of Saito, his company's biggest competitor, in Level 2, when he has been warned before by \"Mr. Charles\" that his subconscious is endangered by intruders?", "Since Fischer has been told that he is in a dream and is being protected by his subconscious projections, he could simply assume that Saito is one of these projections, or as he is shown to not be fully aware of the current affairs of his father's business, Fischer Jr. may not have known or seen Saito before."], ["If the air hostess was clearly in on the First Class setup, why did Cobb have to sneak the drug into the drink?", "Cobb smuggled the drug on-board and possibly didn't have time to brief the hostess on its use. Also, even if the hostess gave Fischer spiked water, it was no guarantee that he would drink it immediately, which is why Cobb offers the drink to him and proposes a toast."], ["It's almost impossible to keep track of who's in whose mind when. Does it matter?", "Nolan acknowledges that it's not easy to follow: Right before the dreamers head down to Level 3, an exasperated Ariadne asks, \"Wait -- whose subconscious are we going into?\" But once you know what to look, or more importantly, to listen for, the clues are all there. The opening sequence is Arthur's dream (the villa) inside Nash's dream (the apartment). The training exercises follow a similar pattern: first the teacher (Cobb in the cafe; Arthur on the Penrose staircase), then Ariadne in her own version of the same environment. The main mission is Eames' dream (the snow fort) inside Arthur's dream (the hotel) inside Yusuf's dream (the city). Limbo is apparently limbo; it doesn't belong to anyone, although Cobb can claim squatters' rights. One relatively easy way of keeping it straight is that the person whose dream it is stays behind in order to keep an eye on the place. Yusuf drives the van; Arthur fights the guard in the hotel; Eames sets the explosive charges. Is this simply a matter of convenience, or are dreams limited to one apiece? Can you fall asleep in your own dream? It would seem so, because Cobb and Mal went down several levels, presumably on their own."], ["How did Cobb and Saito end up in the same limbo? Why not each their own?", "Limbo is unconstructed (i.e. not pre-constructed by an architect) dream space. It, like all levels of subconsciousness when hooked up to the machine, is a shared environment between the dreamers. The only thing there is anything created by a dreamer that has been down there before and is sharing the dream with you. Cobb and Saito share the dreams all the way until level 3 when Cobb goes down to limbo but Saito doesn't. Then Saito dies and heads to Limbo. Cobb, who entered Limbo through the machine (not via death) now dies (either in the hospital, elevator, van, or all three, it doesn't really matter). Since Saito died before Cobb in level 3 many years have gone by for him, accounting for his age; the passage of time there is unpredictable, not at a nice 20:1 proportion like the other levels."], ["What is the significance of the Penrose Stairs in relation to the structure and meaning of the movie?", "The concept of the infinite staircase (Penrose stairs) is used as a blueprint for the structure and form of the film and ultimately for its meaning. The fact that no definite conclusion can be given as to whether it's reality or a dream points that the entire movie is designed as one infinite staircase where the levels of the dream and reality are an analogy for the stairs in the infinite staircase. The Penrose stairs being an impossible structure, this movie presents us with an impossible concept/dilemma that the movie can be either reality or dream depending on how you look at the arguments. It's similar to circling the Penrose stairs in a clockwise or counterclockwise direction that determines whether you are ascending or descending."], ["The last kick we see (The van falling off the edge) wakes everyone but Cobb and Saito up (Who are in limbo) but then they're all seen breathing in the van for a while. How did they suddenly get back to the plane?", "Possibility #1: Although some may believe that the air hostess simply knocking each passenger off their seat would wake them, others suggest it's more likely that the pilots dipped the plane momentarily (given Saito owned the airline). It is unlikely however that the air hostess or pilots could have been prepared to apply a kick as A- They didn't provide a musical countdown, and B- Eames suggests that the original time scale of the plan was a lot slower, with him having the whole night to crack Fischer. Since they didn't know in advance that Fischer's mind would be militarised, why would they have needed to plan a kick?\n\nPossibility #2: Yusuf had designed the sedatives to wear off after a specific amount of time and they simply killed themselves to wake up: This doesn't really make sense because the sedative would have to be in effect for the whole dream; otherwise Cobb couldn't have confidently stated they had a week of dream time. It is possible however that Yusuf had an antidote he had given to the air hostess to administer at a specific time.\n\nPossibility #3: They waited around for another 6 days till they simply awoke from the dream. Fischer's subconscious was militarized, HOWEVER, they don't attack until Fischer gets kidnapped. So one could assume that once the van hits the water, the others wait underneath in order to avoid being seen by Fischer, so Fischer assumes he is now safe, and in the real world. So his subconscious would then back off and not cause them trouble.\n\nPossibility #4: Since the ending of the film is ambiguous; the whole ending with them waking up on the plane might not be reality. And therefore is not proof that the rest of the crew made it out of the first level of the dream. If we are never shown Eames, Yusuf, Ariadne and Fischer waking on the plane in reality, then for all we know, they're still hanging out in level one. (NOTE: Actually we ARE shown every single member of the team after Cobb wakes up in the plane: Eames (behind Cobb), Fischer (in front of Cobb), Arthur, Ariadne, Saito (who remembers the arrangement and makes the call) - and all of them again in the airport, this time including Yusuf and Miles: Eames (left, when Cobb approaches the Immigrations desk), Ariadne (behind \"Gale Bertram\", the Immigrations officer), Yusuf and then Arthur (lugage zone), Eames, Saito and Fischer right after that and finally Miles saying \"Welcome\". Everyone gets some screen time during the superb \"Time\" soundtrack. Everyone except Mal, which is a clear sign that he WAS NOT dreaming anymore - we know Mal only makes dream/recollection appearances. So: [Reality: the train --> the plane] [Dream: the rest]).\n\nIMPOSSIBILITY: Some claim that Yusuf isn't shown on camera after the van drives off the bridge, which could imply that he woke from the dream (because he was conscious when the rest in the van weren't) and turned off the dream machine/woke them up in reality. However Yusuf IS shown on camera after the van sinks into the river - we see him breathing with the scuba gear and stumbling to the shore. Also, the opening extraction sequence shows us exactly what happens when a dreamer wakes up while other people are still asleep in his dream - the dream world collapses on them. This obviously doesn't happen.\n\n"], ["How come when the van drives off the bridge in Level One, the dream is in zero gravity in Level Two, but the dream in Level Three has perfectly normal gravity?", "Firstly, we know that the effects of one level have stronger effects on their proceeding level than any after that which is why Saito feels less pain from his gunshot wounds as he gets deeper. Level three is therefore less likely to feel the effects of level one. Secondly, the dreamers in Level one (Specifically Arthur, because Level Two is Arthur's dream) are feeling a zero-gravity drop which causes Level Two to lose gravity. However the dreamers in Level Two, (Specifically Eames because Level Three is his dream) aren't FEELING zero-gravity, they're EXPERIENCING a lack of gravity. It's the movement that affects the dreamer not the experience and thus, because the dreamers probably can't feel this weightlessness when they're asleep, it won't affect their dream."], ["How is the dream machine brought to deeper dream levels?", "The dream machine could be planted by the dreamers in each level. The device itself does not need to be duplicated - it could exist as an idea or projection in the dream. For example, the dreamers probably do not understand the exact physics of their weapons but they have an innate understanding and conviction of their effects (bullet piercing, injury, pain, etc.). With training and experience, a dreamer could develop a likewise understanding of the dream machine's properties in order for their subconscious to manage it while inside the dream"], ["In order to be woken up from a dream you have to be kicked from the level above, so how does Ariadne kick herself out of Limbo?", "She knows she's in limbo and she throws herself off the tall balcony (after Fischer).

With Cobb and his team having exposed deception that Browning had employed at one point, this leads them to follow the possibility that Fischer's father wanted what was best for his son and therefore, allow him to trust his own judgment when it came to anything involving such. Thus, Browning attempted to have Fischer continue running the company the way his father did so it would benefit him, while Fischer's father who had not realized how much he had neglected his son until the end of his life had actually desired better for him. Fischer himself believes in the idea of doing right in his own life per his father's wishes by deciding to break up the company, which is not only what Cobb, Saito and the team sought to happen in the end, but rather what Fischer was destined to do to begin with.

Everybody involved brought so much more to tell the story, I felt a little ashamed of the book. \" (\"How to Start a Fight\" booklet, included with 2-Disc DVD)"], ["What is the Narrator's name?", "The Narrator's ('Edward Norton' (qv)) name is never specifically stated in either the novel or the film. In the novel, The Narrator finds old Reader's Digest magazines containing articles written by organs in the first person, wherein the organs identify themselves as either Joe or Jill's organ (eg Joe's colon, Jill's medulla oblongata etc). After reading this, The Narrator occasionally says, \"I am Joe's sense of...\" to describe how he is feeling. In the film, something similar happens (although the filmmakers weren't allowed to use Readers Digest, so instead used the fictional magazine, Annotated Reader. They also had to change the name of \"Joe\" to \"Jack\" due to copyright issues with the publisher of the original articles). However, neither Joe nor Jack is the actual name of The Narrator. Some fans suggest that perhaps The Narrator's real name is in fact Tyler Durden, and because his alter ego was more dominant, the name was applied to that alter ego rather than himself. In the novel however, The Narrator shows Marla his driver's license, and says only that the name on it is not Tyler Durden.\n\nInterestingly, the blurb on the back of the _Fight Club_ (qv) DVD, as well as the Public Service Announcements bonus feature, refer to the character as Jack, and the chapter list for the film is called 'Jack's Chapters'. On the other hand, if you watch the movie with closed captions, the Narrator is called Rupert (one of the pseudonyms he uses at the support groups). As a final point of interest, on his DVD commentary, actor 'Edward Norton' (qv) claims to know what the character was 'really' called, but he refuses to reveal it to anyone, even director 'David Fincher' (qv). In the same commentary however, Norton does acknowledge that in the script, the Narrator's dialogue was marked by the name Jack. Marla Singer ('Helena Bonham Carter' (qv)) even asks him when they first meet, \"What should I call you? Cornelius? Rupert? Any other of the fake names you use?\" And he doesn't answer."], ["Why are there four single frame flashes of Tyler Durden prior to the Narrator actually meeting him?", "As astute viewers will have observed, Tyler Durden appears in the film six times prior to the scene where The Narrator meets him on the plane. Four of these appearances are single-frame flashes, which director 'David Fincher' (qv) refers to on his DVD commentary as \"subliminal Brads\" (a single frame is 1/24 of a second in duration, just slow enough for the human eye to register). The first subliminal Brad appears while The Narrator is standing at the photocopier at work, trying to stay awake; the second appears as the doctor ('Richmond Arquette' (qv)) tells The Narrator that to see what real pain is, he needs to attend the testicular cancer support group; the third as the support group leader ('George Maguire' (qv)) makes his opening remarks; and the fourth as The Narrator watches Marla Singer ('Helena Bonham Carter' (qv)) walk down an alley. Durden's fifth and sixth appearances are not single-frame flashes but cameo appearances: he is the furthest waiter on the right in the hotel welcome video and a passerby on a walkway in an airport.\n\nOn his DVD commentary track, 'David Fincher' (qv) explains that the idea behind the subliminal Brads was to convey a sense of exasperation on the part of Tyler Durden; it is as if The Narrator has already created Tyler, but is hesitating to release him. The subliminal Brads are an attempt to illustrate Tyler's frustration with The Narrator -- if The Narrator would simply allow him free reign, Tyler could tackle many of the problems holding The Narrator back. Significantly, all four subliminal Brads appear at times of stress, as if Tyler is choosing these precise moments to remind The Narrator that a solution is within his grasp, he just needs to follow through with it."], ["Did The Narrator blow up his own condo?", "Yes he did, whilst in the guise of Tyler; prior to the car crash near the end of the film, Tyler Durden reveals that he blew up The Narrator's apartment. However, as we subsequently discover, Tyler is simply a figment of The Narrator's imagination, so the implication is that The Narrator blew up his own apartment, whilst in the Tyler persona. The problem some viewers have with this concerns the question of when he may have done it. After The Narrator loses his suitcase in the airport, he goes straight home to find his apartment on fire, prompting some to suggest he had no time to destroy the apartment. Similarly, when Detective Stern ('Thom Gossom Jr.' (qv)) of the Arson Unit calls, he says freon was sprayed into the condo's front-door lock and the cylinder shattered with a chisel. He then says that the gas was probably just used as a detonator for home-made dynamite (to which Tyler has already alluded, when he met The Narrator on the plane for the first time). As Stern makes no mention of a timer, one must assume that after the plane landed, Tyler became 'active', left to blow up the condo, and then got into a cab somewhere. Then The Narrator's personality reasserted itself some time prior to his own arrival back at the apartment.This is partly supported by the theory that the scene depicting The Narrator attempting to retrieve his lost suitcase may itself be imagined, and in reality, he is actually in the process of blowing up the apartment, and covering it up from himself with this imagined scene. Evidence for this interpretation is provided by the fact that Tyler is seen jumping into a convertible in the background, prompting someone to yell at him, \"that's my car,\" indicating that Tyler is really stealing a car. Obviously, as a figment of the Narrator's imagination, Tyler could not do such a thing (which 'David Fincher' (qv) acknowledges on the commentary track), and hence The Narrator could be imagining the entire scene so as to cover up his own actions."], ["When Tyler is rehearsing his \"You are not\" speech in the basement, why does the film jump as if it has come off the projector?", "According to 'David Fincher' (qv) on his DVD commentary, the idea of having the film literally jump from the gate was a way to convey to viewers the intensity of moment. As Tyler crystallizes his manifesto and begins to develop his philosophy beyond the _Fight Club_ (qv)s and into Project Mayhem, things become so intense that even the celluloid itself can no longer handle or contain the intensity, and therefore it jumps in the projector; it is as if Tyler's words are so powerful and important that they are affecting everything around them, even the film on which the scene is printed. It is also one of many moments where the film breaks the 4th wall. Other scenes which use this method include the voiceover narration, the 'flashback humor' joke, the 'subliminal Brads', both the narrator and Tyler directly addressing the audience/camera and the penis splice at the end. These breaks of the 4th wall, force the viewer to think outside of the film, thus facilitating a more objective analytical response, in the classic Brechtian style."], ["Can the Space Monkeys hear both Tyler Durden and The Narrator?", "'David Fincher' (qv) himself raises this question on his DVD commentary. During the scene when Tyler and The Narrator have the argument in the car prior to the crash, 'Fincher' (qv) speculates as to whether or not Ricky ('Eion Bailey' (qv)) and The Mechanic ('Holt McCallany' (qv)) can hear both Tyler and The Narrator's voices or just The Narrator's. The film makes it fairly clear that the Space Monkeys can hear both Tyler and The Narrator when they are being spoken to directly, but it offers no real clues as to whether or not both voices are audible when they are talking to one another. At one point during the argument, Tyler does turn around and address Ricky and The Mechanic, and they answer him, but again, this is a direct address, it is not part of the conversation between Tyler and The Narrator. Ultimately, the film offers no solid evidence as to whether or not the Space Monkeys can hear Tyler's voice when he is speaking to The Narrator, leaving it up to each individual viewer to reach his/her own conclusions. It could be said that The Space Monkeys heard the conversation but mistook it as Tyler speaking to them directly. Hence why they kept reciting the rules of fight club despite being told to shut up."], ["What does \"flashback humor\" mean?", "In the opening scene of the film, as he holds the gun in The Narrator's mouth, Tyler asks him if he has anything significant to say to mark the occasion, to which The Narrator replies, \"I can't think of anything.\" Later, when the film returns to this scene, and Tyler again asks The Narrator if he has anything to say, The Narrator says, \"I still can't think of anything,\" to which Tyler replies, \"Ah, flashback humor.\" This is simply a joke for the more film savvy members of the audience (as 'David Fincher' (qv) himself points out on his DVD commentary). The second time we see the scene, it should be an exact copy or replay of the first time we saw it. This is because it is the exact same scene, just shown twice. Because most of the film is a flashback which occurs after Tyler has asked The Narrator if he has anything to say, but when the scene replays, it begins prior to him asking the question, The Narrator is actually acknowledging that we have already seen this scene by referring to our original viewing of it (hence the word \"still\" in his answer the second time around). The addition of the word 'still' is what prompts Tyler to say ''Ah, flashback humor;\" it is as if The Narrator is acknowledging that two hours (the duration of the film) have passed since he was last asked that question (which, of course, is exactly what has happened from a viewer's point of view), when in reality, he is really only being asked for the first time (from the character's point of view). As such, the use of the word \"still\" is simply a piece of self-reflexive humor, and to embellish the self-reflexivity of the moment, Tyler himself actually comments on it."], ["What happens at the end of the film?", "Due to the graphic nature of the gunshot at the end of the film, many viewers believe that The Narrator actually kills himself and therefore only 'imagines' the last few moments of the film as he dies. Director 'David Fincher' (qv) does acknowledge on his DVD commentary that the gunshot causes confusion because it is so outrageous, appearing to actually go through The Narrator's jaw. However, The Narrator is depicted as supposedly having suffered no serious injury, and importantly, if you look at the scene closely, you can see the bullet ricochet off his jaw and bounce back out of his mouth, thus explaining why the apparently fatal injury was not in fact fatal. In the novel, The Narrator's face is much more grotesque than in the movie as he already has a hole in his face due to the fight with Tyler. The gunshot then hits the other side of his face, causing another hole, which connects with the original hole, creating a huge, Joker-like grin.\n\nTo examine the scene further, there are all sorts of theories as to the symbolism of the gunshot and its effect, primarily in relation to the death of Tyler. Some argue that the gunshot was The Narrator's final way of 'hitting bottom' as Tyler wanted, so therefore Tyler ceased to exist, as he was no longer needed. By attempting suicide, The Narrator is obviously no longer afraid of death or pain (which is what Tyler is trying to teach him during the scene where he pours lye on his hand). For this reason, Tyler's role becomes obsolete, because The Narrator had only created Tyler initially so as to express the more reckless nature which he had tried to repress. Others argue that the gunshot represents The Narrator's absolute rejection of Tyler, thus killing him. This is based on the concept that the bullet did in fact pass through the Narrator's head, but since he was two people, it was Tyler who was killed and not The Narrator (hence the exit wound in the back of Tyler's head). In this sense, it is significant to note that the affliction from which The Narrator seems to be suffering, Dissociative Identity Disorder (DID), has been known to be 'cured', or otherwise eradicated, if the patient experiences a traumatic event; receiving a gunshot to the face undoubtedly counts as a traumatic event. Another possibility is that the bullet went through a portion of The Narrator's brain, causing a pseudo-lobotomy and removing the \"Tyler\" part of his consciousness.Yet another argument is that rather than Tyler dying and The Narrator surviving, the two characters merge. After the gunshot, The Narrator has clearly become a different person, evidenced primarily by the fact that he stops denying his feelings for Marla. Additionally, the flash of the penis just before the credits would seem to support the idea that Tyler is still alive 'somewhere', hence the merging theory."], ["I've heard that 'Brad Pitt' (qv)'s penis is seen in the film. Is this correct?", "No. Upon the release of the movie, a rumor began to circulate that the penis at the end of the film was in fact that of actor 'Brad Pitt' (qv). However, this was nothing more than a rumor. As 'Chuck Palahniuk' (qv) and 'Jim Uhls' (qv) mention on their DVD commentary, the penis belongs to someone else entirely (although they have no idea who). Regarding the casting process for the single frame, 'Edward Norton' (qv) humorously states in his commentary track that \"'David Fincher' (qv) appears in all his own films.\""], ["Who, or what, is Tyler Durden?", "This brief section touches on only three possible ways to interpret the character of Tyler; there are a myriad of others.\n\nOn the most basic level, Tyler Durden is a figment of the Narrator's imagination. The Narrator seems to be suffering from Dissociative Identity Disorder (DID). According to the  Encyclopedia of Mental Disorders, DID is a condition in which a person has more than one distinct identity or personality states. At least two of these personalities repeatedly assert themselves to control the affected person's behavior. Each personality state has a distinct name, past, identity, and self-image (see here for the full article).According to Psychology Today, The individual experiences two or more distinct identities or personality states (each with its own enduring pattern of perceiving, relating to, and thinking about the environment and self). At least two of these identities or personality states recurrently take control of the person's behavior. Each may exhibit its own distinct history, self-image, behaviors, and, physical characteristics, as well as possess a separate name. Particular identities may emerge in specific circumstances. Alternative identities are experienced as taking control in sequence, one at the expense of the other, and may deny knowledge of one another, be critical of one another or appear to be in open conflict (see here for the full article).\nThese two passages seem to offer a good summary of the Narrator's predicament: Tyler Durden is an alternative identity of the Narrator. A common argument regarding the aspect of the Narrator's personality represented by Tyler is to equate him with the id. This is what 'Brad Pitt' (qv), 'Edward Norton' (qv) and 'David Fincher' (qv) do on their DVD commentary, arguing that Tyler is essentially a manifestation of the Narrator's id, insofar as he partakes of all the things of which the Narrator is afraid to partake and acts in ways the Narrator wishes he could act. He quite literally is the Narrator's suppressed desires and yearnings.\n\nHowever, for many fans of the film, for numerous critics and scholars, and for many of the filmmakers themselves, it isn't quite that simple. Whilst they acknowledge that Tyler is a figment of the Narrator's imagination, they are also keen to explore what exactly he represents in and of himself, beyond the Narrator; taking Tyler as a standalone character, what exactly does he signify? According to 'Edward Norton' (qv), A lot of people have been responding to Tyler as a sort of Nietzschean \u00dcbermensch in the sense that he's advocating liberation of the human individual through the rejection and destruction of the institutions and value systems that are enslaving us. (Graham Fuller, \"Fighting Talk: Interview with 'Edward Norton' (qv)\", Interview Magazine, 24:5 (November, 1999); available here).\nHowever, as Norton points out on his DVD commentary, Tyler's methods ultimately veer into the same dehumanizing tactics used by the systems he claims to abhor, such as when he orders around the members of Project Mayhem with a megaphone or when he denies them names.The tension in the film comes from my character asking, \"What are the limitations of a nihilistic attitude?\" It can be enthralling, it can be seductive, it can feel liberating on certain levels. But at what point do the practical applications of it start to become exactly the things they're critiquing, and at what point do Tyler's initiatives start to dehumanize people just as much?In this sense then, Tyler's manifestation, and ultimate corruption, of the Nietzschean concept of nihilism is rejected by the Narrator, but the point is that Tyler represents a sort of corrupted nihilistic ideology; \"It's a critique of how Nietzsche becomes Hitler\" (''Edward Norton' (qv) Yale Interview', (October 3, 1999); available here, and on all 2-Disc DVD versions of the movie). In this sense, Tyler represents the excesses to which flawed ideology can fall victim.\n\nLooking at Tyler as a symbol for a political manifesto is only one interpretation of the character, albeit the most common. A compelling alternative is provided by Adrian Gargett in his article \"doppelganger: exploded states of consciousness in fight club\". In this article, Gargett takes a basic psychoanalytical approach to interpreting Tyler, ignoring the political imperative of the role, and arguing instead that he functions primarily as the Narrator's double: The Double explores the spiritual dimension -- the representation of a desire for immortality. ... [The Narrator] develops Tyler in the identification of a secondary, apparently hostile component of his personality with a 'physical' double -- who may be real or imaginary. Tyler is not simply a physical replicant of the protagonist, but a complementary addition to his own identity. The Double originates from within the host as an external expression of repressed emotions/desires. Via doubling, an alter-ego is created that embodies a demonic subjectivity. Tyler is a manifestation of the narrator's sense of incompleteness and parental abandonment (Adrian Gargett, \"doppelganger: exploded states of consciousness in _Fight Club_ (qv)\",disinformation (August 22, 2001); available here). Of course, this is not dissimilar to suggesting that Tyler is simply a manifestation of the Narrator's id.\n\nIn the end, however, the character remains indefinable and unquantifiable, with each viewer investing him with meaning based on his or her own subjective reaction to the movie."], ["So, if the film is not about fighting, what does the fighting represent?", "The fight scenes are a means to an end, a metaphor for something beyond themselves. The film is not literally about men beating each other up; the fighting serves a purpose beyond its superficial connotations. _Fight Club_ (qv) is concerned with the why behind the fighting, and the fight scenes are invested with symbolic meaning that obviates the superficial \"violence for the sake of violence\" interpretation.\n\nAs 'Edward Norton' (qv) points out, \nThe violence of the fight clubs serves as a metaphor for feeling, rather than to promote or glorify physical combat. The fights are tangible representations of resisting the impulse to be cocooned in society. Fighting between the men strips away the fear of pain and the reliance on material signifiers of their self-worth, leaving them to really experience something valuable (Louis B. Hobson, \"Get ready to rumble,\" Calgary Sun, (October 10, 1999); available here).\nNorton also argues that\nThe idea of the fighting is not about the suggestion that violence directed outward toward other people is a solution to your frustrations. It's very much a metaphor for self-transforming radicalism, the idea of directing violence inward at your own presumptions. Tyler doesn't walk out of the bar and say, \"Can I hit you,\" he says \"Will you hit me?\" It's this idea that you need to get shaken out of your own cocoon. The fighting is a metaphor for stripping yourself of received notions and value systems that have been applied to you that aren't your own. And freeing yourself to discover who you actually are ('Edward Norton' (qv), Round Table Interview, (September 28, 1999); available here).\nThe fighting serves as a metaphor for the shaking off of the shackles imposed by contemporary society, a means of discovering aspects of one's self which one would not be exposed to were one to toe the line. _Fight Club_ (qv) suggests that society has become so oppressive that to find out anything about themselves, men must do something extreme, like engaging in violent physical combat. In Norton's argument, the extremity of the fighting is in fact a commentary on the oppressiveness of society: only by doing something extreme can one free oneself. As such, the fighting serves simply as a metaphor for how downtrodden and subjugated men have become in this corporate culture of advertising.\n\nNumerous critics, however, disagree with the metaphoric connotations of the fighting, arguing instead that the film was only about physical violence, there was nothing beneath the surface or between the lines, and as such, the film was reprehensible, insofar as it encouraged such actions amongst its (apparently infantile and unintelligent) intended audience. Film scholar Gary Crowdus summates the views of such critics when he points out that \nthey felt the fight scenes served only as a mindless glamorization of brutality, a morally irresponsible portrayal, which they feared might encourage impressionable young male viewers to set up their own real-life _Fight Club_ (qv)s in order to beat each other senseless (\"Getting Exercised over _Fight Club_ (qv),\" Cineaste, 25:4 (September, 2000); quoted in 'Jethro Rothe-Kushel' (qv), \"_Fight Club_ (qv): A Ritual Cure For The Spiritual Ailment Of American Masculinity\", The Film Journal (February 2004); available here).\nNumerous critics fit Crowdus' description, but none better than 'Roger Ebert' (qv), who called the film \nA celebration of violence in which the heroes write themselves a license to drink, smoke, screw and beat one another up. Sometimes, for variety, they beat up themselves. It's macho porn -- the sex movie Hollywood has been moving toward for years, in which eroticism between the sexes is replaced by all-guy locker-room fights (_Fight Club_ (qv) Review, Chicago Sun Times, (October 15, 1999); available here).\nEbert also said the film included \"some of the most brutal, unremitting, nonstop violence ever filmed\" -- a bizarre claim which prompted some to ask if he'd even seen the film. Another excellent example is 'Kenneth Turan' (qv), who called the film \na witless mishmash of whiny, infantile philosophizing and bone-crunching violence. Director 'David Fincher' (qv), with _Alien\u00b3_ (qv), _Se7en_ (qv) and _The Game_ (qv) in his past, is one of cinema's premier brutalizers, able to impale audiences on meat hooks and make them like it. So it's no surprise that _Fight Club_ (qv)'s level of visceral violence, its stomach-turning string of bloody and protracted bare-knuckles brawls, make it more than worthy of an NC-17 if the MPAA could ever work up the nerve to give that rating to a major studio film...aside from the protracted beatings, this film is so vacuous and empty, it's more depressing than provocative (_Fight Club_ (qv) Review, Los Angeles Times, (October 15, 1999).\nTo accuse the film of being simply about violence is to analyse it on the most superficial level possible. The fighting in the film carries metaphorical significance which far outweighs its literal violent connotations."], ["How are we to interpret the film?", "The most common argument as to what the film is primarily about is that it deals with the conflict between young people and the corporate value system of advertising which has become an integral part of the society in which they find themselves. In this sense, the film is very much anti-materialist, and deals with the schism created when someone can no longer tolerate the value system with which they are simply expected to comply. This system of advertising has become so ingrained into all aspects of contemporary society that when one tries to reject it, one is quite literally engaging in a personal revolution. Furthermore, the film probes the problems caused by the system and a corporate dominated society insofar as it examines what that society has done to the men who inhabit it. Males, traditionally, the hunter/gatherer, have been reduced to what Louis B. Hobson calls \"a generation of spectators\" (\"Get ready to rumble\", Calgary Sun, (October 10, 1999); available here), their inherent 'abilities' as men no longer needed for the smooth running of society (as Tyler Durden points out in the scene where he chastises The Narrator for knowing what a duvet is, asking how such knowledge helps in \"the hunter/gatherer sense\"). Instead of a need for survival and a desire for moral and spiritual well-being, man is instead driven by a desire for material 'things,' a desire instilled by a society of advertising which defines a person based upon their possession of what Jim Slotek calls \"external signifiers of happiness\" (\"Cruisin' for a bruisin,'\" Toronto Sun, (October 10, 1999); available here). This in turn creates a pointless and ultimately empty obsession with possessing items which ultimately come to possess the owner, and causing an abandonment of the search for spiritual happiness. It is this very society which the film critiques.\n\nHowever, this is but one interpretation of a film which is open to a virtually any reading. A good way to engage with the various possibilities as to meaning is to look at what some of the filmmakers themselves have said about their own interpretations of the work. This selection of quotations offers a broad cross section of their opinions:\n\n'Chuck Palahniuk' (qv) (author): \"We are a nation of physical animals who have forgotten how much we enjoy being that. We are cushioned by this kind of make-believe, unreal world, and we have no idea what we can survive because we are never challenged or tested\" (Movie EPK; quoted here).\n\n'Jim Uhls' (qv) (screenwriter): \"It's about numbness and alienation and finding self-empowerment through drastic means\" (\"How to Start a Fight\" booklet, included with DVD).\n\n'Brad Pitt' (qv): \"_Fight Club_ (qv) is a metaphor for the need to push through the walls we put around ourselves and just go for it, so for the first time we can experience the pain\" ('Club fighting for a respectful place in life,\" Post-Tribune (March 15, 2001); quoted in Wikipedia article).\n\n'Chuck Palahniuk' (qv): \"It offers people the idea that they can create their own lives outside the existing blueprint for happiness offered by society\" (\"How to Start a Fight\" booklet, included with DVD).\n\n'Edward Norton' (qv): \"To me it's very much a story about a person who feels at odds with everything he's expected to engage in. Who hits a juncture in his life and chooses to move toward the seduction of negativity and nihilism. There's this presentation of a guy who's kind of hilariously desperately out of sync with all the things he's supposed to participate in, who kind of has this Elaine Robinson, or in Marla's case, he has this women who's kind of like his female doppelganger. She is him. And he recoils from it. It's like he recoils from the image of himself and moves toward what turns out to be this idealized vision of himself, as opposed to himself the way he is. There's this moment that I really like in the phone booth where he attempts to call her. There is this moment where he could call her and go after the simple human connection that ultimately by the end he kind of realizes he should have gone after all along. And he almost calls her, and he hears her voice and it sounds too much like him and he hangs up and he goes the other way. He goes toward this idea of a new version of himself. And explores that negativity and all its excess. That's what interested me. This idea of the seduction of the negative. Like, you know, sort of Tyler as Mrs. Robinson. This exploration that has consequence, terrible, terrible consequence and that you have to wake up from it and ultimately reject it to get to a sort of new middle ground. Tyler gets him to give up on God, but ultimately he has to give up on Tyler and give up on the excesses of what Tyler is suggesting that men ought to be. He's found what his own boundaries are, he's not his old self, but he's not willing to go all the way in this new self\" (''Edward Norton' (qv) Yale Interview', (October 3, 1999); available here and on all 2-Disc DVD versions of the movie).\n\n'Bret Easton Ellis' (qv) (author of _Less Than Zero_ (qv), _American Psycho_ (qv), _The Rules of Attraction_ (qv) and _Lunar Park_ (qv)): \"_Fight Club_ (qv) rages against the hypocrisy of a society that continually promises us the impossible: fame, beauty, wealth, immortality, life without pain. It's a relentless, dizzying take on the male fear of losing power\" (\"How to Start a Fight\" booklet, included with DVD).\n\n'Ross Grayson Bell' (qv) (producer): \"The underlying theme is that you have to break yourself apart to build something new. It is only when you realize that you're not your lousy hair, or your bad debts, or your fears that you're not good enough, that you can actually create a new life for yourself\" (\"How to Start a Fight\" booklet, included with DVD).\n\n'Ross Grayson Bell' (qv): \"It shocks you into looking at who really controls your life: you or your fears.

I've looked for things as an actor and director that I thought were specifically kind of generational nerve pieces or pieces that I thought were about my generation and its particular dysfunctions and relationships with the culture. And I haven't run into very many. And I never felt like the films that were getting made that were targeted at us, sort of the  _Reality Bites_ (qv) version of us as a generation, were very on-target for me. I always thought it was very baby boomer, kind of concocted, somewhat over-simplistic. And I thought a somewhat disdainful reduction of us to this kind of Gen-X, slacker, aimless, low energy, angst-ridden kind of banal realism and I just didn't buy it, and I certainly didn't respond to it. It didn't seem to me to speak to some of the deeper things that I was feeling. And this was the first thing I'd read where I just laughed all the way through it. I laughed because there were passages in it that were just instantaneously impressed in my brain. The idea of a generation that's had its value system largely informed by the advertising culture is really provocative to me. On a certain level, in the absence of collective spirituality, there is a notion that the external signifiers of your material life will make you happy. That you'll find spiritual peace through home furnishing. And it just made me laugh, it made me laugh because I was in the process of furnishing my house. And it was making me feel calm, for a while. And I felt like so much of what peeves me about the culture that I can't necessarily put a finger on, was named in this book. It was very focused on this idea of men and their sense of being displaced, their role in the culture being displaced. Of absentee fathers and the effect of that. There's stuff about it that are classically Nietzschean almost. I thought this is a piece about the challenge of individual self overcoming. Of making yourself evolve and of shattering old value systems and received value systems and institutional kind of hierarchies to free yourself individually. And about what happens, what are the practical limits of applying that as a philosophy in the real world. And at what point does that start to become the thing that it was seeking to free people from? The solution becomes negative and destructive and dehumanizing in the sense that all of these guys give up their names to become part of the movement that's supposed to be freeing them? I was thinking, \"Jesus, you know, this is a critique of fascism.\" Or it's a critique of how Nietzsche becomes Hitler\" (''Edward Norton' (qv) Yale Interview', (October 3, 1999); available here and on all 2-Disc DVD versions of the movie).\n\n'Edward Norton' (qv): \"It has a generational energy to it, a protest energy. So much of what's been represented about my generation has been done by the baby boomers. They dismiss us: the word 'slacker,' the oversimplification of the Gen-X mentality as one of hesitancy or negativity. It isn't just aimlessness we feel; it's deep skepticism. It's not slackerdom; it's profound cynicism, even despair, even paralysis, in the face of an onslaught of information and technology\" (Joanna Schneller, \"'Brad Pitt' (qv) & 'Edward Norton' (qv) Interview\", Premier, (August, 1999); available here).\n\n'Edward Norton' (qv): \"I feel that _Fight Club_ (qv) really, in a way probed into the despair and paralysis that people feel in the face of having inherited this value system out of advertising\" (Stephen Schaefer, \"Two of Hollywood's hottest thirtysomethings embrace mayhem and millennial meltdown in _Fight Club_ (qv)\", movies.com; available here).\n\n'Edward Norton' (qv): \"This idea of our generation having its value system largely dictated to it by advertising culture and by all these cultural signifiers telling you what your life is supposed to be, what are the trappings of your life, that if you take them on will result in spiritual happiness. Like the idea of being sold all of our lives, the idea that you will achieve spiritual peace through home furnishing or your material possessions or that happiness is tied to lifestyle. And the phenomenon that I think our generation has been going through of waking up into adulthood and recognizing the emptiness of that promise and the inability of that promise to be fulfilled by those acquisitions and kind of the whole idea of a received value system really isn't working for you or making you happy and what do you do at that point? I've always felt that our generation in particular is a generation that is having its midlife crisis in its twenties. And I think that that on some level is a very healthy thing, but it is disturbing. I felt the film in those themes. It also dealt more specifically with how men in particular feel emasculated in the contemporary culture. It was kind of like some weird '90s version of reading Nietzsche in college. It was like Thus Spoke Zarathustra. It's about two people exploring how do we liberate ourselves from value systems that aren't ours or that have been applied to us and that we've been told we ought to accept and exploring the practical limitations of that kind of nihilism\" ('Edward Norton' (qv), Round Table Interview, (September 28, 1999); available here).\n\n'Edward Norton' (qv): \"'Fincher' (qv) was always very firm in saying that it needed to be a film about two people exploring certain questions and in the end, going in two different directions. There's a dialectic between Brad's character and my character and at the end, things happen a certain way, but you're essentially left without a pat theme or glib conclusion by the film. It doesn't get wrapped up in a neat package for you so that you can walk out and say, \"Oh, the message of that film was this.\" You have to, in essence, take it out of the density of it all. You have to think about it a little bit and decide was Tyler's practical execution of this idea of self-liberation through kind of an anarchism negative. Did that become negative in its own right? Did the people surrounding them lose their identity as much as they had been before they got into this whole thing? Or was The Narrator afraid to go the final mile? And I liked all of that as a general approach to the film, the idea of wrestling around in it and leaving it in an audience's lap\" ('Edward Norton' (qv), Round Table Interview, (September 28, 1999); available here).\n\n'Laura Ziskin' (qv) (President of Production, Fox 2000 Pictures): \"The movie is really about the causes of violence and is, in fact, anti-violence, although it acknowledges those impulses in human nature. If art can't examine those issues then we are in a lot of trouble\" (\"How to Start a Fight\" booklet, included with DVD).\n\n'Edward Norton' (qv): \"It is the responsibility of people making films and people making all art to specifically address dysfunctions in the culture. I think that any culture where the art is not reflecting a really dysfunctional component of that culture, is a culture in denial. And I think that's much more intensely dangerous on lots of levels than considered examinations of those dysfunctions through art. I don't believe that it's the chicken and the egg question. I do think there is violence in our culture. I think there always has been violence in our culture in one form or another. I think that it's a very appropriate discussion to ask what are the ways in which the presentations of violence affect us. I would aim those questions more at films that present violence in a way where it's presented as entertainment or where violence is made an aesthetic in its own right. I think that there's a legitimate question as to how certain presentations of violence without impact affect us all. But I don't think that the violence that is in our culture means that art shouldn't examine that violence. I think that if we were to refrain from serious examinations in art of the kind of ways in which we're unhealthy or ways in which we're dysfunctional as a culture, then we wouldn't have most of the things we point to as landmarks in our cultural landscape. Nabokov wouldn't have written Lolita out of fear that an old man would go and molest a young girl. 'Scorsese' (qv) would have never made _Taxi Driver_ (qv)  and the Beatles wouldn't have written The White Album, because Manson might use it as an outlet for his pathologies. My grandfather really didn't like _The Graduate_ (qv). He thought it was negative and subversive, but my father loved it. And I think you would erase most of the serious discussion about our dysfunctions if you did that. I don't think it's the responsibility of filmmakers to account for every possible misinterpretation of a film that you might make. I would think that would quell serious debate too much. I think it would quell serious considerations of the ways that we're unhealthy. I think that it's a very, very appropriate film. Films are a potent, arguably one of the most potent, cultural mediums that we have right now and it's totally appropriate for them to be entertaining. But I think it's also critical that a medium as potent as film be examining the ways that we're unhealthy. And I've never worked on a film where violence was romanticized in the sense of being presented without impact or where the roots of it weren't being examined specifically as the intent of the film. And so I've never hesitated on that score where my films are concerned because I feel like it's very important sometimes to hold an uninflected mirror up to those things. Or to just hold any mirror up to those things. It's meaningful to me to work on pieces that wrestle around in territory that we're all very uncomfortable with. When we first started going out with the press on this 'Fincher' (qv) said something like, \"If it doesn't piss off a healthy number of people then we've done something seriously wrong.\" And I agreed. I hope it rattles people. I hope it dunks it very squarely in your lap because I think one of the things we strove very specifically to do with this was on some levels retain a kind of a moral ambivalence or a moral ambiguity - not to deliver a neatly wrapped package of meaning into your lap. Or in any way that let you walk away from the film like this, comfortable in having been told what you should make of it. Or what the theme was. And I think that's fine too. Another film that I worked on, _American History X_ (qv), I think was a much more thematically packaged film. I think it was just like a tragedy. It was intended to have a prescriptive message. But this is not. But a big part of the intent of this was to point a finger at certain things and name them, and dump it in your lap and say, \"What do you want to make of that?\" I think it's intentionally surreal, it's intentionally metaphoric and I think it's not for kids\" (''Edward Norton' (qv) Yale Interview', (October 3, 1999); available here and on all 2-Disc DVD versions of the movie).\n\nNumerous scholars and critics have also offered their own interpretations of the film. For example:\n\nAlex Burns (film scholar): \"It is a fable about postmodern consumer society and the potential for an American fascism. _Fight Club_ (qv) belongs to a social protest movement that has emerged since the Cold War's endgame, typified by fears about trans-national corporations, media-savvy activists, and the demise of the traditional bi-polar political framework\" (\"fight club: a postmodern consumer parable\", disinformation, (May 3, 2001); available here).\n\nAdrian Gargett (film critic): \"The men who become members of _Fight Club_ (qv) are victims of the de-humanizing and de-sanitizing power of contemporary society, inhabiting an essence of identity marketed by consumer culture. The only way they can regain a sense of individuality is by locating the primeval and \"barbaric\" instincts of pain and violence. The Narrator can only define himself in terms of male, consumer, insurance worker, insomniac, but he feels that he has lost any sense of self. He is confined by the mechanisms society adopts for categorization\" (\"doppelganger: exploded states of consciousness in fight club\", disinformation, (August 22, 2001); available here).\n\n'Jethro Rothe-Kushel' (qv) (filmmaker): \"The film comments profoundly on America's problems of meaning (e.g. indentured servitude to capitalism in a land of freedom, violence in a land of justice, consumer Darwinism in a land of community, meaning in a post-modern reality that understands all meaning as a relative cultural construct, etc.). In sociological terms, [The Narrator], a white male, could represent the hierarchical leadership of the American patriarchy; \"I was the warm little center that the life of this world crowded around.\" America seems to love him, but he feels hurt and betrayed by his culture and the dulled-down consumerist dreams he has inherited. Without Tyler, [The Narrator] is a spineless, volumeless, emotionless, placid, and flaccid half-man. His creation of Tyler allows him to reclaim his masculinity amidst a culture of post-feminist, cathartic, self-help groups. The film frames America lacking a public venue to integrate the emotional component of white male identity. When there is a communal or cultural void, history suggests that violence can complete that lack. _Fight Club_ (qv) exposes the void and offers three solutions: crying, violence, and movies. It asks the question, what do you want to do with the Narrators of our country - those unwanted children of America who were raised on cultural action hero myths and yearn to live those stories?\" (\"_Fight Club_ (qv): A Ritual Cure For The Spiritual Ailment Of American Masculinity\", The Film Journal (February 2004); available here).\n\nAdrienne Redd (political and social critic): \"Prima facie, _Fight Club_ (qv) is about masculinity, but with the crucial proviso that it is about masculinity among a specific class of American men: the burgeoning stratum of service or gray-collar workers. There was a time when blue-collar workers could invest in a kind of honor and mythology of hard physical work, but the world has changed and now former steelworkers are parking cars, waiting tables, and watching security monitors. They have not even the solace of big muscles and the solidarity of unions from which to construct their identities and with which to salvage their bruised egos. And as a character says in the film, they lack a great cause, like a war or depression, in which to test themselves. _Fight Club_ (qv) is really about what it is to be a man who serves others (as women have traditionally) and how such men construct identity and meaning in their lives. That women now can take most of the jobs that men can is certainly a background fact, but the film explores other issues or sources of masculinity. This ties into the American dream and the mythology that anyone can become rich or become president. Part of the way that the working poor are lulled into cooperating and staying in the service of richer classes is by this unspoken promise that if they work hard they will ascend to higher security and status. The film is also about escaping conventional society. Representative of escaping out the top of a cold and constrictive society are the references to being a millionaire or a celebrity. Representative of escaping out the bottom are the constant references to \"trying to hit bottom\" to attain a freedom that doesn't come until one has nothing to lose\" (\"Masculine Identity in the Service Class: An Analysis of _Fight Club_ (qv)\", Criticism.com (June 27, 2004); available here).\n\nHilary Johnson (film scholar): \"It is about the imminent large-scale social and economic obsolescence of the male species. Men are failing at work, at school and in families, in theory because the modern knowledge and skill-oriented world is basically testosterone-intolerant. While men's strength and aggression were useful in establishing the modern world, they are an impediment to its smooth day-to-day operation, a task better suited to the instincts and behavior of females\" (Village Voice; quoted in Nick Roddick, \"_Fight Club_ (qv): How Hard to be a Man?\", Urban Cinefile; available here)."], ["Is this film pro-fascist?", "Upon the release of the film, it was primarily vilified by critics for two reasons: glamorizing violence and pro-fascism.\n\n'Roger Ebert' (qv) called it \"the most frankly and cheerfully fascist big-star movie since _Death Wish_ (qv)\" (_Fight Club_ (qv) Review, Chicago Sun Times, (October 15, 1999); available here). 'Alexander Walker' (qv) claimed that \"it echoes propaganda that gave license to the brutal activities of the SA and the SS. It resurrects the F\u00fchrer principle\" (London Evening Standard; quoted in \"How to Start a Fight booklet, included with DVD).\n\nFans of the film argue that on the surface, the film may seem to flirt with a radical political ideology which could be called pseudo-fascist (or, based on Project Mayhem's anti-corporatist actions, Anarcho-primitivist), but if one looks a little deeper, one can see that the film ultimately rejects the tenets of Tyler Durden's Project Mayhem, and any leanings towards fascism along with it. As director 'David Fincher' (qv) says, \"Isn't the point of fascism to say, 'This is the way we should be going'? But this movie couldn't be further from offering any kind of solution\" (Damon Wise, \"Menace II Society,\" Empire, (December, 1999); available here). Even the British Board of Film Classification (BBFC) made this observation about the film's so-called pro-fascist message: \nThe film as a whole is - quite clearly - critical and sharply parodic of the amateur fascism which it in part portrays. Its central theme of male machismo (and the anti-social behavior that flows from it) is emphatically rejected by the central character in the concluding reels (quoted in Adam Dawtrey, \"UK to Cut Club\", Variety (September 11, 1999); available here).\nAs such, the very simple answer to the question of whether or not the film is pro-fascist is: No, it isn't; at least it certainly isn't as far as the filmmakers themselves are concerned. As mentioned above, the film does flirt with a fascist ideology upon the initial founding of Project Mayhem, but as Tyler's ideas become more and more radical and dangerous, The Narrator (and the film) pulls back from them, disassociating himself (and itself) from his ideology and ultimate goals. As the BBFC points out, the film concludes with The Narrator completely rejecting the pseudo-fascist ideology of Tyler, a rejection shared by the film itself. In layman's terms, by the end of the film, Tyler has very much become the villain, with The Narrator presented as the desperate (and righteous) protagonist. With that in mind then, to say that the film is simply 'pro-fascist' because it initially presents a pseudo-fascist character in an attractive light is to grossly oversimplify things, not to mention completely miss the point of the d\u00e9nouement."], ["What is the connection between this film and the Columbine massacre?", "Quite simply, _Fight Club_ (qv) was the first mainstream movie with violent content to be released after the Columbine incident, and as such, it was the first film to be attacked in the press and accused of fostering the violent attitudes in society which led to the murders. As screenwriter 'Jim Uhls' (qv) explains, \"It gave moral pundits a shot at something tangible, a scapegoat. It's a film about fist fighting, but it made the 'mistake' of showing too much blood. These same opposing voices were silent about clean, fun-looking automatic rifle slaughter in films released before Columbine.\" (\"How to Start a Fight\" booklet, included with DVD).\n\nSimilarly, as 'Edward Norton' (qv) has argued, \nTo make some glib associative link between this film and Columbine is just lazy journalism. It's not giving it a sophisticated treatment. And even to the degree that there is some sort of link, violence is in the culture and if art stops addressing the violence in the culture, then you're got a culture in denial, in essence. I think it's a completely legitimate debate, and the thing to question is how violence is presented in films. Oftentimes violence is presented as entertainment or violence is presented without impact or almost as a pure aesthetic itself, for example, _The Matrix_ (qv), a film where violence was literally violence as ballet. And those raise interesting questions. But for my money, I think a film that is in essence about the dynamics that go into shaping people's frustrations, I think the idea of squelching that kind of discussion is more dangerous than having the discussion and having it be misinterpreted by anybody. You wouldn't have most of the things that we now see as great cultural landmarks, that were mirrors up to the times. You wouldn't have _Taxi Driver_ (qv) or _Strangelove_ (qv) or _A Clockwork Orange_ (qv) if people had said, \"I'm not going to make this because it might be misinterpreted as espousing this.

The way they would get Candie's attention would be to discuss buying one of his prized Mandingo fighters for $12,000, which at the time was an outrageous amount of money. This prompts Calvin Candie to show them his hospitality and take them to his home where Broomhilda is being kept. Knowing that Broomhilda had been owned by Germans and spoke German, Schultz requests the \"pleasure\" of her company. The next evening, when discussing the transaction of the Mandingo fighter for $12,000, Schultz would mention how much he enjoyed conversing in his native German tongue with Broomhilda and request to purchase her as well for a modest sum, the transaction of which could happen immediately. _Django_ (qv) and Schultz would then leave with Broomhilda, leaving Candie with the impression that they were going to consult with Schultz's lawyer about securing the funds to purchase the Mandingo fighter and simply never return. Schultz needed to pay for Broomhilda so there was a bill of sale, much like when he \"bought\" _Django_ (qv). His reasoning was, if _Django_ (qv) and Schultz simply absconded with Broomhilda, they would be labelled thieves and if caught, would be hanged and Broomhilda would be returned to Candie."], ["Wasn't _Django_ (qv) and Schultz's plan to get Broomhilda from Candie unnecessarily complicated?", "Many people who watch the film may feel that there are far simpler ways to go about the situation. Quentin Tarantino recently acknowledged the viewer's questions in an interview with Mike Ryan which can be read here. Tarantino stated that Schultz likes to create complicated schemes to go about claiming his bounties. For example, at the beginning of the film, Schultz brings _Django_ (qv) into a saloon and chases the bartender out while explicitly telling him to make sure he gets the Sheriff. Not the Marshal, but the Sheriff. Once the Sheriff arrives at the saloon, Schultz promptly executes him in front of the entire town. Next the Marshal arrives and the entire town are pointing their guns at _Django_ (qv) and Schultz. Schultz goes outside and explains that the Sheriff was actually living under a false name and was really a wanted criminal. This was a complex and possibly dangerous way of doing it. All he really had to do was go to the Marshal and explain who the Sheriff was beforehand. When it came to buying Broomhilda, Schultz explained that he didn't want to simply offer to buy her from Calvin Candie because Schultz wanted to make sure she was purchased legally (with a bill of sale) and also he didn't want to let Candie be in the position of power. Schultz wanted to pay $300 to save her from Candie. But if they went straight to Candie and said, \"We wish to purchase Broomhilda for $300,\" all Candie had to say was \"Well, she obviously means something special to you...so you'd be willing to pay $1000, I'm guessing.\" Schultz simply could not let someone as detestable as Calvin Candie get the upper hand on him. This helps explain why Schultz refuses to shake Calvin's hand as well."], ["Why didn't _Django_ (qv) let Schultz pay for D'Artagnan?", "Calvin Candie was posturing that he expected to get 5 fights out of a Mandingo fighter before they could retire (or die). D'Artagnan begs with Candie, saying he can't fight anymore. Candie then says he wants back the $500 he paid for him. Naturally nobody there, including D'Artagnan had $500 to spend, nor did they care to. Candie had no intention of actually getting reimbursed, he fully planned on killing D'Artagnan. When Schultz jumped up and exclaimed that he would reimburse Candie for D'Artagnan, Candie immediately became suspicious. \"Why would a man trying to get into Mandingo fighting want to spend $500 on a slave who can barely stand?\" was Candie's line of thinking. _Django_ (qv) realized that if Candie or any of his associates saw through the ruse, both he and Schultz could very likely be killed or at very least, be sent away without Broomhilda. This is shortly after Schultz chastised _Django_ (qv) for getting too carried away with his character of being a black slaver. So _Django_ (qv) says that Schultz wasn't actually willing to pay for D'Artagnan, he was just trying to get Candie to stop toying with him. Candie then orders his men to sick the dogs on D'Artagnan, who then rip him to shreds. The entire time, Candie stares _Django_ (qv) dead in the eyes to see if there would be a crack in _Django_ (qv)'s fa\u00e7ade. _Django_ (qv) manages to keep his composure, but Schultz was noticeably disgusted. Candie says to _Django_ (qv) \"Your boss is a little green around the gills for wanting to get into a sport like nigger-fighting.\" to which _Django_ (qv) explains \"Nah, he's just not used to seeing a man ripped apart by dogs is all.\". Calvin, still suspicious says \"But you are used to it?\" and _Django_ (qv) says \"Let's just say I'm a little more used to Americans than he is.\", finally diffusing the situation. D'Artagnan was dead either way. _Django_ (qv) saw this and so continued with the ruse that he was a black slaver that didn't care about the life of a slave, although he clearly shows some remorse towards D'Artagnan and his fate as soon as Candie returns to his buggy. At the end of the film, he gets revenge for D'Artagnan by bursting into the Trackers' cabin and shouting \"D'Artagnan motherfuckers!\" before gunning them all down."], ["Why did _Django_ (qv) kill the slavers who agreed to help him?", "_Django_ (qv) killed the LeQuint Dickey Mining Co. slavers for a couple of reasons. First and foremost, they were slavers -- men who made a living off of working slaves to death in horrible conditions. _Django_ (qv) would have been one of those slaves if he hadn't tricked them. _Django_ (qv) manages to talk them into letting him go and giving him a gun by fooling them into thinking that the Smitty Bacall gang was hiding out at Candie Land and that there was a $12,000 bounty on the gang. So all the LeQuint Dickey group had to do was ride in and kill them and they'd be able to collect the bounty. _Django_ (qv)'s request was that he be allowed to carry a gun and help kill the Smitty Bacall Gang and receive $500 of the bounty (giving the other three $11,500 to divide among themselves). However, _Django_ (qv) and Schultz had already killed all of the members of the gang prior to their visit to Candie Land and the $12,000 was used to purchase Hildi. So, once they arrived at the plantation and found out they had been duped, the LeQuint Dickey employees likely would have just in turn killed _Django_ (qv) or at the very least made him pay for his deception. So _Django_ (qv) had the drop on them and killed all three and likely without any remorse, given their profession."], ["How many people die in the Candieland shootout?", "At least 20: Candie, Schultz, and Butch Pooch are shot in the first two rooms. Schultz shoots Candie with his small hidden sleeve pistol, and Schultz gets shot with a shotgun by Butch Pooch. _Django_ (qv) then shoots Butch with one of his own pistols before chasing Leonide Moguy into the foyer to shoot him and all of the armed plantation men that attack. In the final shot of the foyer, you can see at least 11 corpses lying around on the floor. That's 14. Also, there are two house slaves who get shot by a group of plantation henchmen coming in the back door, which is 16. A few of the corpses also land outside the front door, and there are at least four corpses there, so that ultimately leads to a final body count of at least 20 people dead by the end of the scene. (though the one called \"Jesse\" who is shot repeatedly by the front door is still alive by the end of the scene. He may have survived if he didn't die from his wounds.)"], ["Did _Django_ (qv) need to shoot Lara Lee? Wasn't she innocent?", "Calvin Candie's sister, Lara Lee was far from innocent. She lived on a plantation and clearly had no issues with how her brother brutalized his slaves and likely had a say in how they were punished as well. She constantly held up her nose above the black race, viewing them as nothing more than inferior, sub-human animals. She also had no hang-ups about prostituting her slaves to her guests, given how she dragged Broomhilda up to Dr. Schultz's room. While some might bring up as proof of Lara's righteousness when Stephen and Calvin show off Broomhilda's whipped back and Lara chastises them, it's actually due to her eating dinner and not wanting to be repulsed by looking at mutilated skin. At the end of the film, she was the one who originally wanted to have _Django_ (qv) castrated, but changed her mind and decided to sell _Django_ (qv) to the LeQuint Dickey Mining Company for a slow, brutal, agonizing death, after Stephen subtly suggests it. Not to mention, Lara Lee was making Broomhilda into a \"comfort girl\" for both the Mandingos and the slave wranglers. Despite the fact that _Django_ (qv) really didn't \"need\" to shoot Lara Lee, as she was unarmed and posed no imminent threat to him, it's understandable as to why he'd want to take revenge on her. In fact, people could even agree that Lara was taken out the easiest, quickest and cleanest way by _Django_ (qv) compared to most of the other villains of the film. For example, _Django_ (qv) is shown gunning down Billy Crash multiple times and leaves him suffering and wailing a few moments before finally shooting him dead; _Django_ (qv) also violently shoots the elderly Stephen in both of his kneecaps before casually walking out of the Big House, leaving the old man screaming in agonizing pain for several long minutes until the plantation blows up."], ["Does Quentin Tarantino have a cameo?", "Yes. Two, in fact. He plays one of the Regulators (a.k.a. Bag Heads, the one that says \"I think we all think the bags were a nice idea. But, not pointing any fingers...they could have been done better. So...no bags this time. But next time, we do the bags right and we go full regalia!\"). He also plays one of the Australian slavers of the LeQuint Dickey Mining Company (the one who explodes when _Django_ (qv) shoots the dynamite bundle he is carrying)."], ["What is the song that plays when ______?", "\"_Django_ (qv) Theme Song (English Version)\" by 'Luis Bacalov' (qv) & 'Rocky Roberts' (qv), from _Django_ (qv) - The opening credits.\n\n\"The Braying Mule\" by 'Ennio Morricone' (qv), from _Two Mules for Sister Sara_ (qv) - _Django_ (qv) and Dr. Schultz ride into Daughtrey.\n\n\"Rito Finale\" by 'Ennio Morricone' (qv), from _Citt\u00e0 violenta_ (qv) - Dr. Schultz explains to _Django_ (qv) how he needs his help to track down the Brittle brothers.\n\n\"Main Titles Theme Song (\"_Lo chiamavano King_ (qv)\")\" by 'Luis Bacalov' (qv) & 'Edda Dell'Orso' (qv), from _Lo chiamavano King_ (qv) - Dr. Schultz's theme\n\n\"Norme Con Ironie\" by 'Ennio Morricone' (qv), from _Citt\u00e0 violenta_ (qv) - Old Man Carrucan explains to _Django_ (qv) his plans to sell him and Broomhilda separately.\n\n\"Town of Silence (2nd Version)\" by 'Luis Bacalov' (qv), from _Django_ (qv) - _Django_ (qv) first tells Dr. Schultz about Broomhilda, _Django_ (qv) reminisces about first seeing her.\n\n\"Gavotte\", arranged by Grace Collins - _Django_ (qv) and Bettina tour the grounds of Bennett Manor\n\n\"Town of Silence\" by 'Luis Bacalov' (qv), from _Django_ (qv) - _Django_ (qv) spots one of the Brittle Brothers in the field.\n\n\"Freedom\" by 'Anthony Hamilton' (qv) & Elayna Boynton - _Django_ (qv)'s flashback: watching Broomhilda getting whipped, trying to escape with her, and begging Big John to spare beating her.\n\n\"La Corsa (2nd Version)\" by 'Luis Bacalov' (qv), from _Django_ (qv) - _Django_ (qv) gets revenge on the Brittle Brothers.\n\n\"Requiem ('Giuseppe Verdi' (qv)) - Prologue\" by 'Masamichi Amano' (qv) & 'Polish State Philharmonic Orchestra' (qv), from _Batoru rowaiaru_ (qv) - The Regulators gather and organize themselves.\n\n\"I Got A Name\" by 'Jim Croce' (qv) _Django_ (qv) and Schultz traveling together through the snowy landscapes.

However, once someone has an epiphany and their mind is opened up to such matters, it is rarely closed back up. Yes, Danny was killed by a black man, as was their father. However, Derek would still understand that not everyone was like that. Dr. Sweeney is a perfect example as he wanted to do nothing but good and help troubled youths. The last line Derek says in the film is \"What have I done?\". In this it could be implied he does not revert to his old ways but blames himself for what has happened. This would mean he would not revert to his old ways as his brother's death would be in vain. Henry killed Danny as his vengeance for Derek killing and curb stomping his brother.

The Eagles did not take sides in the War of the Ring until the end, so they would not have assisted Frodo when he started his quest. This is similar to the Ents, who only participated when they felt they were drawn in by Saruman. The Eagles are also very proud creatures, who will not allow themselves to be used as just a means of transportation. The Eagle, Gwahir, that rescued Gandalf ('Ian McKellen' (qv)) from the tower of Saruman ('Christopher Lee' (qv)) did so as a special service to Gandalf, whom he knew personally (Gandalf had previously saved his life). In addition to this, there are allusions that while Sauron was still in power, the Eagles would have struggled getting to Mount Doom, not least because of the wraiths on their fell-beasts and other dark creatures and powers that Sauron had at his disposal. Sending Frodo on the back of an eagle into Mount Doom would have been effectively air-mailing the ring to Sauron. A ground-based approach was decided to be much more effective and appropriate.

According to Tolkien, though, after Aragorn dies in the year 120 (Fourth Age), Arwen returns to L\u00f3rien, where she dies by choice the following winter."], ["How does Shelob's stinger penetrate Frodo's mithril vest?", "The novel states Shelob stung Frodo in the neck, not in the chest as depicted in the film: \"Shelob with hideous speed had come behind and with one swift stroke had stung him in the neck.\" (The Choices of Master Samwise) While we see Shelob impales Frodo in the front with her stinger, we don't see exactly where he was stung. We only see a close-up of Frodo's face while being stung. He could have been stung in the leg, the inner-thigh, or other areas the vest doesn't cover. There are two wounds visible on Frodo's chest; one from the Morgul Blade suffered during the battle at Weathertop. The other is the wound left after the cavetroll stabbed him in Moria."], ["Why didn't Aragorn just send the ghosts into Mordor to kill Sauron's orc army?", "In myth and legend, unlike real life, kings were measured by nobility and the honoring of commitments. Aragorn commanded the army of the dead to fulfill their oath by helping him with one battle. Any attempt to send them into another battle would have backfired. He showed his worthiness by honoring his word even though it might have seemed easier to try and do otherwise. Also, the ghosts couldn't kill Sauron. At most they could have given him a fight. From the author's perspective, it would have been too easy of a solution and rendered Tolkien's Eucatastrophe meaningless, a Hobbit, the unlikeliest of creatures, defeating Sauron. From a story standpoint, it would have been a shortcut that would have made the overall story suffer.\n\nWhile the above speculation is interesting, in truth the ghost army was hardly as powerful in the book as they were in movie. In fact in the book, as with most ghosts and wraiths throughout the book they have very little power (except for the Nazgul, ie. Ring Wraiths, the most powerful ghosts in the story). In fact all they can really do is scare people, as they do in the book when the Dead Army serve their purpose and scare the Corsairs off their ships. It is these ships which Aragorn commandeers with the D\u00fanedain and the garrison force of Pelargir (the city where the Corsair ships have just taken). While maybe not as cool as seeing a Ghost Army waft over the army of Mordor and kill everyone, in the book the actual point of the whole story is that the time of elves and dwarves is gone and the War of the Ring ushers in the Fourth Age of Middle Earth or the Age of Men. And so it is just three representatives of the former (Legolas, Elladan, and Elrohir) and one of the later (Gimli) who help the Rohirrim, the D\u00fanedain, and the Gondorians, all of which are men who defeat the army of Mordor and Harad. So in other words, Aragorn doesn't just \"send the ghosts\" because it would have done all of about nothing, and the film makers obviously had a very slim grasp on not only the understanding of the point of the book, but also the parameters of the universe that Tolkien had very carefully set up for decades before the books were published."], ["Why doesn't Gandalf use his magic against the enemy armies?", "Essentially, the Istari were not allowed to use their magic to directly influence or affect the people of Middle Earth. They were to remain in the background and aid when and where they could. But when confronted by other immortals such as the Balrog, Ringwraiths, other Istari, etc, they were allowed to use whatever means at their disposal."], ["What does Frodo mean by \"the wheel of fire?\"", "Just before Sam begins to carry Frodo the last leg up the slopes of Mount Doom, Frodo tells him \"there is no veil now between me and the wheel of fire.\" This references the fact that in the book, Frodo had begun to see an image of a wheel of fire in his mind beginning around the time they crossed into Mordor. By the time they have reached the mountain, he is seeing it with his eyes, as if it was a real image. The film retains his admission of this fact to Sam, but does not mention his prior visions. The wheel itself most likely refers to the One Ring."], ["Why does Sam say \"I can't carry it for you, but I can carry you!\"? Why couldn't Sam just carry the Ring himself?", "Frodo would not have given it to Sam, and Sam knew that. Earlier, Frodo told Sam, \"I must carry this burden to the end. It can't be altered. You can't come between me and this doom.\" From the book, just before Sam says \"I can't carry it for you\" there's this:Sam knew before he spoke, that it was vain, and that such words might do more harm than good, but in his pity he could not keep silent. 'Then let me carry it a bit for you, Master,' he said. 'You know I would, and gladly, as long as I have any strength.'\n\nA wild light came into Frodo's eyes. 'Stand away! Don't touch me!' he cried. 'It is mine, I say. Be off!' His hand strayed to his sword-hilt. But then quickly his voice changed. 'No, no, Sam,' he said sadly. 'But you must understand. It is my burden, and no one else can bear it. It is too late now, Sam dear. You can't help me in that way again. I am almost in its power now. I could not give it up, and if you tried to take it I should go mad.'When Sam says,'I can't carry the Ring for you', this response from Frodo is motivating him. To even suggest he carry the Ring has highly distressed Frodo. To push the matter or to force it, would likely drive him mad."], ["What happened in the end of ROTK where a gaping chasm swallowed Mordor's army?", "Just something 'Peter Jackson' (qv) made up for cinematic effect. What happened according to the novel was this: (From The Return of the King, The Field of Cormallen): \"...the creatures of Sauron, orc or troll or beast spell-enslaved, ran hither and thither mindless; and some slew themselves, or cast themselves in pits, or fled wailing back to hide in holes and dark lightless places far from hope.\" Also, in the novel, violent earthquakes tore through much of Mordor, so Jackson could have be incorporating that into his film. The cracking of the earth does indeed coincide with the eruption of Mount Doom. Perhaps when Sauron was destroyed, his lands were destroyed along with him, as if anything over which he held power (buildings and lands) was also destroyed. We do know that Orcs were created from corrupted Elves, and in the prologue of Fellowship of the Ring we saw how the Orc army seemed to dissolve when Sauron's Ring was cut from his hand. Since Sauron can use the Ring's power to rule over others, it may be reasonable to assume that when the source of power is taken away or destroyed, everything that the power controls or brought about is also eliminated. This does not explain why the Orcs don't 'dissolve' at the end, so perhaps this means that they were not created with the Ring's power, only persuaded and enslaved by it."], ["How much time passed from when the hobbits left the shire to when Frodo and Sam reached Mordor?", "According to the book, Frodo leaves Bag End on September 23rd and reaches Mount Doom on March 25th of the following year. So that's six months. But, there were long stays in Rivendell and Lorien (three months, total) so the actual journey was substantially less."], ["Why did Frodo have to leave Middle-earth?", "Frodo ('Elijah Wood' (qv)) didn't have to leave at all. He chose to depart from his home because he couldn't settle back into his old life. The Shire folk pride themselves on the ignorance of problems outside of their homeland. The corruption of the ring, the near-fatal wound from the Witch King, and his newfound knowledge of the fragility of his little community left him with an outlook on the world that couldn't be covered by the formerly peaceful and blissfully ignorant life-style of the Shire folk. He was unable to heal emotionally from his experiences, as the wound he received from the Witch King never fully healed and caused him intense pain from time-to-time, as well as flashbacks of the event. Frodo eventually died a true death, as the Undying Lands cannot make mortal beings, such as men or hobbits, into immortal beings. In the director's commentary on the dvd, 'Peter Jackson' (qv) says that departing to the West is a metaphor for death. Remember what Galadri\u00ebl ('Cate Blanchett' (qv)) said to Lord Elrond in The Two Towers about Frodo: \"The quest will claim his life.\" While the quest did not kill Frodo physically, it did end life for him as he knew it in Middle-earth."], ["What happened to the other members of the original fellowship?", "Although the film shows the departure of only Frodo, Bilbo ('Ian Holm' (qv)), and Gandalf, other members of the fellowship are known to have traveled to the West. Legolas also made the journey, taking with him Gimli (the only Dwarf allowed to sail to Valinor). Samwise left after Rosie died and he had served seven consecutive terms as mayor of Hobbiton. He was allowed to make the journey because he was, for a short time, also a ring-bearer. Aragorn served his term as King and then died a natural death. His son, Eldarion, took up his mantle of King. Merry and Pippin never went over the sea. They died at Minas Tirith and were buried in the tombs of the kings, and later placed next to Aragorn when he died."], ["What is the total strength of the Mordor army that besieges Minas Tirith?", "In the Special Features section of the movie, the total number is stated to be 600,000 strong."], ["Why was Gimli the only dwarf to help aid in the war of the ring?", "Gimli was the only one as part of the fellowship, but Dwarves were fighting Sauron's army in their own lands. The War of the Ring was fought throughout Middle-Earth - we only saw a portion of it."], ["Wasn't there another Wizard named Radagast?", "There were five Wizards (or Istari): Saruman the White, Gandalf the Grey, Radagast the Brown (who spent most of his time with animals and plants and lived near Mirkwood), then the two \"Blue Wizards\"--Alatar and Pallando (later changed to Morinehtar and Romestamo)--who went into the East and were never heard from again. After the Council of Elrond (as per the novel), Elvish scouts tried to find Radagast at his home near Mirkwood but he was gone. His absence was never explained. Radagast was not in the film version though he does appear in The Hobbit Trilogy."], ["Why did the catapult operators of Minas Tirith use their wrecked towers and walls as ammunition?", "Convenience! Laying siege to a city means that getting supplies, like regular rocks or other ammo, inside is nearly or totally impossible. Also, it makes for a great dramatic statement onscreen: seeing what you destroyed hurled back at you is a great way to say \"UP YOURS!!\" to the Host of Mordor. Interestingly enough, in the books the walls of Minas Tirith were supposed to be unbreakable, like Saruman's tower in Isengard."], ["Why does Gothmog call the heads of the dead Gondorian soldiers \"prisoners\"?", "It's a form of irony. Gothmog and his army had captured them, and probably tortured and beheaded them. Launching the heads over the wall of Minas Tirith was a terror tactic. Calling them \"prisoners\" was a way to make Gothmog seem even more evil."], ["What are Orcs, exactly?", "They are tortured versions of elves originally captured by Morgoth the first Dark Lord or they are poor imitations (a mockery) of elves created by Morgoth--depending on the source. Tolkien worked this over most of his life and had several versions of the same story that he refined over the years. Both are versions that he had come up with. The Two Towers cites the first explanation. Trolls are perhaps wicked imitations of Ents."], ["Did Hobbits shave their faces?", "Mostly no. Most Hobbits did not grow facial hair, the primary exception being those of the variety known as Stoors (who were also known for their unusually large hands and feet)."], ["What is the fate of Shadowfax?", "According to one of Tolkien's published letters, Shadowfax \"certainly went with Gandalf across the Sea\"."], ["Is Sauron seen in this film?", "Sauron's physical form is not seen in the film, only his eye which rests on the top of the tower of Barad-Dur. However, the 4-disc special edition DVD set has a documentary that has original footage of Aragorn ('Viggo Mortensen' (qv)) fighting Sauron ('Sala Baker' (qv)). He also appears very briefly in the scene where Pippin ('Billy Boyd' (qv)) looks into the Palantir. He is in the same form as shown in the first film's backstory. The filmmakers originally wanted to give Sauron a more active role at the end, as opposed to the static eye on top of the tower that he was in the previous films. The confrontation originally started with Aragorn walking out of the group towards the Black Gate, as he sees a ghostly apparition of Sauron in his original form, a handsome, young, long-haired man - Annatar, the \"Lord of Gifts.\" The group would then become surrounded by Orcs, the giant armoured Sauron among them, who would battle with Aragorn. In the finished film, it is Sauron's eye on the tower calling to him, at which Aragorn is looking. In the documentary, Jackson discusses the reasons that Sauron was later replaced with a computer generated troll who battles Aragorn instead (he felt that the scene didn't ultimately work, as it reduced the struggles of the group and Frodo in particular to an Aragorn vs. Sauron match)."], ["Why is the Mouth of Sauron not included in the film?", "'Peter Jackson' (qv) stated that to include the Mouth of Sauron would be pointless, as the audience already knows that what he is saying is not true. In the book, the fates of Frodo and Sam had not yet been disclosed at that point, lending dramatic tension to the confrontation that would necessarily be absent from the film version. In the Extended Edition, the Mouth of Sauron makes a brief appearance when he tries to trick the Fellowship into thinking Sauron killed Frodo and took the Ring. Aragorn refuses to believe this and subsequently kills the Mouth. Although the scene cannot convey the dramatic revelation of Frodo's 'death', it was reinstated into the Extended Edition because it still works on another level: the (false) knowledge of Frodo's death gives more meaning to Aragorn's emotional line \"For Frodo\" and the sacrifice that he and his army are making."], ["Bilbo is 111 in the first film and 131 at the end of the third; why, then, does he age so much in between?", "Ownership of the Ring gave Bilbo unnatural youth, just as it did to Sm\u00e9agol/Gollum (who is over 500 years old). Once he gave the Ring away, Bilbo began to age as he should have. (Bilbo's age at the end is based upon the timeline in the books, though in the film versions there is nothing to indicate that seventeen years passed between Bilbo's departure and Gandalf's return; his age in the film version may be closer to 114, though it is never specified either way except by 'Peter Jackson' (qv) in a commentary track in the extended edition of The Fellowship of the Ring). It is not clear why Gollum is still alive, having lost the Ring 60 years ago, but it may be assumed that it gave him permanent strength because he had it for so long, or he was able to live on because his desire to take back the Ring was so strong. Also, we see that Bilbo had aged a bit from the time he left the shire to when Frodo met him again at Rivendell. However, he seems to have aged rapidly at the end of the film. It's likely that he didn't start aging quickly until the ring was destroyed. This would also explain why Gollum never aged. Both due to his 500 year relationship with the ring and the fact that the ring still existed when it left him. Since Gollum died with the ring, we won't know for sure, but it's possible he would have withered and died very quickly."], ["What are the differences between the theatrical version and the extended version of the movie?", "For its DVD release, extended versions of all three Lord of the Rings movies have been released, and for The Return of the King, the extended version adds around fifty minutes to the running time. This includes the final confrontation with Saruman, more character scenes with Faramir, and the appearance of the corsairs of Umbar. The restoration of Gandalf's face-off with the Witch King also resulted in extensive re-ordering of the order of battle events, now more closely following the events as presented in the book. A detailed comparison, divided into two parts and with pictures, can be found here (Part One) and here (Part Two)."], ["Why does Saruman's staff break? (Extended Edition only)", "The answer comes in the The Two Towers, The Voice Of Saruman): \"I am Gandalf the White, who has returned from death. You have no colour now, and I cast you from the order and from the Council.\" He raised his hand, and spoke slowly in a clear cold voice. \"Saruman, your staff is broken.\" So, Gandalf breaking Saruman's staff was symbolic of the fact that 1) Gandalf now had authority over him, and 2) that Saruman was cast out of the order (of wizards) and the Council (the White Council of Wizards and High Elves)."], ["Who were those men in ships? (Extended edition only)", "They were Corsairs of Umbar, descendents of the losing side of a Gondorian civil war called the Kin-Strife, and allies of Sauron. Aragorn uses the Army of the Dead (the ghosts of soldiers who had betrayed a previous King of Gondor) to defeat the Corsairs, who then take the ships upriver to fight at Minas Tirith. This is a slight change from the novel, in which Aragorn brings a large number of Dunedain rangers who man the ships and surprise the enemy at Minas Tirith; the ghosts only assist in capturing the ships, and do not accompany Aragorn further into battle."], ["Why was Saruman left out of the theatrical version of the movie?", "The main reason is a combination of storytelling decisions and changes that were made while adapting the books to the movies. The novel of The Two Towers describes the Battle for Helm's Deep, but from there it also continues with Aragorn and Gandalf traveling to Isengard in order to confront Saruman and retrieving the Palant\u00edr; it ends with Gandalf and Pippin's journey to Minas Tirith. This works perfectly well on paper, because it serves to set up the storylines of the third book. For the movie, however, it was decided to make the Battle for Helm's Deep the film's cinematic climax; Director 'Peter Jackson' (qv) has explained in several making-of documentaries that continuing the story from there with a lengthy epilogue would have felt extremely anti-climatic and disappointing. So the decision was made fairly early on to move the Isengard confrontation and journey to Minas Tirith to the beginning of the third movie. This also led to the decision of including Saruman's death in the beginning of the third movie (in the book, it occurred at the end of the third book, but this was also changed, because it would have felt anti-climactic following after the epic battle at the Black Gate).\n\nHowever, a problem emerged there; the theatrical version of Return of the King needed to cover a lot of story elements and a fitting conclusion to the entire trilogy, and it ran already over three hours long. So Jackson did not want to waste time and preferred to get the story on the move as quickly as possible. He felt that the scene at Isengard seemed like an unnecessary aftermath from a previously concluded story, which stalled the movie too much; the Saruman confrontation provided mainly character development and few new information that the plot needed, and Jackson felt that Saruman's defeat had already been shown in the previous movie. But since the scene also reintroduced the Palant\u00edr (the catalyst for the next act), and reunited Gandalf and Aragorn with Merry and Pippin again, it could not be omitted entirely.\n\nJackson re-edited the entire Isengard sequence several times, but he never got the desired pacing, nor was he able to convey the necessity of the scene. Another possible reason may have been that the movie's post-production, with a rapidly approaching premiere date, was an extremely rushed experience, perhaps forcing the decision to heavily cut the scene and fine-tune it later for the DVD edition. So it was decided to leave Saruman's fate out of the theatrical edition altogether. The choice was not without controversy; Tolkien fans balked at the decision, and 'Christopher Lee' (qv) publicly voiced his objection. There was a small consolation: since Jackson had considerably fewer concerns with the pacing of the DVD version (where people can watch at their own leisure, and would expect him to take it slower and go deeper into the story and characters), he had no objections to putting the full scene back into the Extended Edition."], ["What happened with the original ending in the book?", "More specifically, this question refers to the chapter \"The Scouring of the Shire,\" in which the hobbits return to the Shire and find their homeland ravaged by conflict and industrialisation. It appears that Saruman, who fled to the Shire after his defeat at Isengard, was responsible for this and caused a civil war among the hobbits. The running time of the movie was already exceeding three hours, so several large sections from the book had to be omitted. As the movie had already come to a finale with the battle at the Black Gate, another conflict would have felt like an anti-climax, so the decision was made to leave it out. The actual scouring of the Shire was also left out, and [spoiler]Saruman's death[/spoiler] was moved to the beginning of the extended edition of the movie. One reference to the omitted ending remains, and it was seen in The Fellowship of the Ring, when Frodo takes a look into the Mirror of Galadri\u00ebl. There he sees the Shire burning and the hobbits being imprisoned by Orcs, thus witnessing what fate awaits the Shire if Sauron gets the ring back."], ["Why didn't the Orcs kill Shelob considering the fact that Shelob feeds on Orcses?", "Well, Sauron may have wanted her to be alive for the protection of his fort, considering the fact that Orcs are so enourmous in number , occassional feeding of Orcses to Shelob wouldn't cause significant problem.

They write: Certain clues in the wrecked ship lead them across the hostile surface of the planet to a primitive stone pyramid, the only remnant of a vanished civilization. Beneath this pyramid they find an ancient tomb full of fantastic artifacts. Lying dormant in the tomb are centuries-old spores, which are triggered into life by the men's presence. A parasite emerges and fastens itself to one of the men's faces -- and cannot be removed. It would appear that it was the scriptwriters' intention that the _Alien_ (qv)(s) originated on the same planet where the derelict was found. However, as the pyramid was left out of the final script and movie, the only clue remaining is the derelict ship; it seemingly landed or crashed on the planet, indicating that both the ship and the eggs came from a very different, yet unknown place. Notes by designer H.R Giger also indicate that the _Alien_ (qv) species may have been a bio-mechanical weapon created by the \"space jockey\" race (this idea was the basis of the 2012 prequel _Prometheus_ (qv)) . The derelict would therefore have been a military transport ship carrying a cargo of eggs, one of which presumably attacked the crew, causing the crash. This would explain the gun-turret construction aboard the derelict and the fully-grown Xenomorph's mechanical mouth parts, a Xenomorph being the _Alien_ (qv) apart from the parasite that implants it in a person or animal."], ["How can the _Alien_ (qv) grow so quickly in such little time?", "Although such a rate of growth is quite unheard of in Earth's fauna, we should bear in mind that this particular life-form is extra-terrestrial, and therefore not necessarily subject to conventional wisdom about growth and development. Perhaps the _Alien_ (qv) is a physiologically simple creature with all body structures present when it bursts out of its host, and all that is needed is that its cells quickly replicate and grow in size. The latter might be realized by drinking water and eating enormous amounts of nutrients for both energy and building blocks. Such rapid cell division would nevertheless require lots of energy, and this may account for its very short lifespan (the creators of _Alien_ (qv) intended the creature to be aging very rapidly throughout the movie, becoming darker and finally dying at the end); the creature's body quickly invests all its energy into becoming functional, rather than into longevity, much like a butterfly. Think about the life cycle of houseflies and fruit flies: they age very rapidly and usually die in 24 hours."], ["Why was it raining in the cargo bay?", "It was condensation. Down near Brett it appeared quite hot, as he was sweating. Since hot air rises, it could have caused some frost or ice to melt high up on the ceiling. Also, the giant lights that Brett looked up at could have given off a lot of heat."], ["Why is Ripley's nose bleeding after confronting Ash with Special Order 937?", "Although it is not clearly shown, it could possibly be that Ripley banged her nose when she first grabbed Ash by the lapels and began shaking him. It could also possibly be due to intense stress.\nOriginally there was a scene where Parker and Ripley try to close the alien in the main air lock so they can blow it out into space. However the plan goes wrong and due to loss of pressure Ripley starts bleeding from her nose. This scene was only partially shot and never included in the movie. It was supposed to occur after Dallas' death and before she confronts Ash."], ["How does the _Alien_ (qv)'s life cycle work?", "There is no explanation in the movie as no one has encountered this type of alien before. At the beginning of the movie, the Nostromo crew find the dead \"Space Jockey\" with a large hole in his chest. In what looks like a holding area, there are several egg-shaped containers covered in a blue mist. Kane falls into the mist, and one of the eggs starts to react when he comes close to it. The top of the egg slowly opens and as Kane looks inside, a spider-like creature leaps out and attaches itself to Kane's spacesuit helmet. Later, it is discovered that the creature has burned through Kane's helmet and attached itself to his face. It has inserted a long tube down Kane's throat and appears to be providing him with oxygen. Some hours later, the creature simply removed itself from Kane and dies. As Kane seems fine, and the crew decide to eat something before going back into hibernation. As Kane begins to eat, he begins having convulsions and his chest suddenly bursts open and a small creature bursts free. The creature then runs off before the stunned crew can stop it, but it grows at an incredible rate, shedding its skin, and reaches over 8 feet in height in a matter of hours. It then begins picking off the crew one by one. Near the end of the movie, Ripley finds that two of the crew members have been cocooned and are turning into eggs themselves (though this is only in the Director's Cut of the film and even director Ridley Scott has said it is not necessarily considered canon, as in the sequel, a Queen _Alien_ (qv) is present to lay the eggs). In short, the simplest explanation as shown in the movie is that the _Alien_ (qv) is hatched from an egg, incubates in the body of a living host, rips its way out of the host, quickly grows to adult form, and begins searching for other living hosts for future _Alien_ (qv)s to spawn from."], ["Where is the scene showing Brett and Dallas being turned into eggs?", "The cocoon sequence, involving the transformation of Brett and Dallas into eggs, was filmed but was dropped from the final cut of the original release because director Ridley Scott felt that the sequence interrupted the pace of the film. He believed that the inclusion of this sequence interfered with Ripley's attempt to exit the ship, which would have unnecessarily slowed down the picture. The cutting of the cocoon sequence was an attempt by the director to keep tension in the final minutes of the film, not an attempt to alter the intended life cycle. However, Ridley Scott said that the Theatrical Cut is his \"Director's cut\" and any alternate versions are just special editions for fans. Therefore his intention was to leave this scene out. That scene is now available in the Director's cut."], ["Is the derelict ship in this movie the same Predator ship from \"_Alien_ (qv) vs. Predator\"?", "No. There are several reasons for this: (1) The two ships look nothing alike; they have completely different shapes and designs, (2) The Predators look nothing like the dead alien creature (\"Space Jockey\") found inside the derelict. The dead creature is several times larger and lacks the typical Predator mandibles, (3) It is unlikely that the ship would also just happen to crash on LV-426, the planet from _Alien_ (qv) where the derelict is found, (4) In the sequel AVP-R, the Predator ship crashes on Earth, reducing chances to zero of it being the derelict from _Alien_ (qv), and (5) A still functional ship that looks exactly like the derelict is depicted in _Prometheus_ (qv) (2012), which takes place on a different planet to _Alien_ (qv)."], ["Who is the so called \"Space Jockey\"? Where do they get this name from?", "\"Space Jockey\" was the nickname the production designers gave to the dead alien found inside the derelict ship, who was envisioned as the pilot who flew the entire ship from his chair, and most of the crew felt it as a benevolent creature, in contrast to the _Alien_ (qv) itself. The name may be derived from Robert A. Heinlein's short story of the same name, which is about a pilot of a commercial spacecraft. The name stuck among the crew, and the term is widely used in behind-the-scenes material, so it eventually became a sort of unofficial yet informally accepted name for the creature, even though it is never explicitly named as such in the movie. The origin and function of the Space Jockey was kept ambiguous in the movie. During production and for several years later, Ridley Scott considered the possibility that the ship had a military function, and could drop the _Alien_ (qv) eggs as biological weapons onto hostile territory during war."], ["Why would they send people out on their own on the ship with the _Alien_ (qv) loose?", "It seems mostly a combination of inexperience with such situations, panic and bad luck. After the _Alien_ (qv) births from Kane, the crew split up into two groups of three. We follow Ripley, Parker and Brett as they search for the _Alien_ (qv). They come across Jones the cat who runs off. Parker tells Brett to go get Jones so they don't risk picking it up on the motion tracker again. This ultimately leads to Brett's death at the hands of the _Alien_ (qv). But keep in mind that the crew were still expecting to find the _Alien_ (qv) when it was in its chestburster stage. They could not have anticipated the _Alien_ (qv) growing to over 7 feet tall in a matter of hours.\n\nNext, Dallas goes into the air ducts in order to try to bait/flush the _Alien_ (qv) towards the airlock in order to suck it out into space, leading to his demise. This was likely because the air ducts were so small and cramped that having two or 3 people would slow them down greatly and cause more problems than it would solve, including making too much noise. Furthermore, there may have been only one functional flamethrower, and since they cannot use guns due to the risk of the _Alien_ (qv)'s blood burning a hole through the hull, sending in more people without a weapon would leave them defenseless against the _Alien_ (qv). And even if there were more flamethrowers, it would put them in danger of hitting each other. They may not have wanted to risk too many people against an unknown life form anyway. The idea wasn't bad, but unfortunately, with Lambert crying, shrieking and panicking for Dallas to get out of there into his earpiece he understandably moved quickly, without thought and wound up running right into the _Alien_ (qv).\n\nShortly thereafter, Ripley asks Parker to refuel one of the flamethrowers. Though she tells Ash to go with him, Parker refuses (seemingly because he doesn't like/trust Ash). There is a brief scene that shows Parker moving cautiously through the ship to get the fuel. He manages to get back without incident.\n\nFinally, Parker and Lambert go on together to collect supplies, as Ripley goes after Jones the cat on her own. Ironically, it is not the solitary Ripley who is singled out by the _Alien_ (qv), but Lambert and Parker. They may have thought that, since the _Alien_ (qv) had restricted its activity to the lower deck and places with access to the ducts, Ripley would be safe on the upper deck anyway; and since it always targeted people who were alone, Lambert and Parker would not be in danger in the supply room as long as they were together. Unfortunately, the _Alien_ (qv) used the fact that they were extremely hurried and neither of both was keeping watch to its advantage, by sneaking up on Lambert; and its close proximity to Lambert prevented Parker from using a weapon."], ["How does the movie end?", "Ripley, Lambert, and Parker prepare to take the shuttle in order to escape from the _Alien_ (qv) aboard the Nostromo. Parker and Lambert are killed by the _Alien_ (qv) while gathering supplies, so Ripley grabs Jones and boards the shuttle after setting the Nostromo to self-destruct. As they drift off into space, the Nostromo explodes. Ripley places Jones in the hypersleep chamber and prepares herself for sleep, too. Suddenly, she becomes aware that the _Alien_ (qv) is also on board the shuttle in a semi-dormant state between some of the shuttle's control panels. She backs herself into a closet containing spacesuits, then has the idea that she can don a suit, decompress the shuttle and blow the _Alien_ (qv) out into space. She buckles herself into her seat and, as the _Alien_ (qv) rises and moves towards Ripley, she opens the main airlock hatch. All of the contents of the shuttle that are not fixed down, including the _Alien_ (qv), are blown out of the hatch, but the _Alien_ (qv) grabs onto the sides of the hatchway as it tries to survive. Ripley then shoots it with a grappling gun which blows the _Alien_ (qv) out into space but the hatchway door slams shut just before the grappling gun is blown out as well, therefore tethering the _Alien_ (qv) to the shuttle. The _Alien_ (qv) then tries to regain entry through the engine casing, but Ripley fires the engines and the _Alien_ (qv) is blown away into space. In the final scene, Ripley and Jones enter hypersleep, hoping to reach the frontier in about six weeks."], ["Was there originally an alternative ending?", "Yes. The film was originally going to end with Ripley simply escaping in the shuttle and the _Alien_ (qv) dying aboard the Nostromo as it self-destructed. However, Ridley Scott then conceived of a \"fourth act\" in which Ripley had to face the _Alien_ (qv) again, as it had managed to stow away aboard the shuttle. His intention was to end the movie on a dark note, with the _Alien_ (qv) biting Ripley's head off, and then mimicking her voice as it made a final log entry. He convinced the studio to allow for extra budget and filming days. The studio agreed, but only on the condition that the _Alien_ (qv) would still die at the end. That is how the current ending came about, which is similar to Shusett's and O'Banion's early script."], ["I heard rumours of a deleted sex scene between Dallas and Ripley. Is it true?", "A sex scene between Dallas and Ripley was in the script, as a way to show how space truckers deal with long periods of abstinence during their long voyages, by simply having casual sex to fulfill their physical needs. This also explains a deleted scene between Ripley and Lambert where Ripley starts having doubts about Ash and asks Lambert if she ever had sex with him (this scene is on the special edition dvd). However, the Ripley-Dallas sex scene was not filmed. Subtle hints that Dallas is protective of Ripley are shown throughout the film, implying he may have feelings for her. When Dallas decides to go outside and walk to the Derelict Ship, he selects Lambert over Ripley for this potentially dangerous mission (although it is possible that he did this to keep one of the ranking officers on board, since he and Kane, being captain and second-in-command, would already be gone). When Ripley, Ash, and Dallas are searching for the facehugger in the medical lab, it falls on Ripley's shoulder. Dallas immediately jumps to protect her and she clutches onto him. Also, when Ripley volunteers to go into the air ducts, Dallas overrules her, and takes her place."], ["What else was planned but not shot?", "Aside from the famous Airlock sequence and sex scene, there were scenes involving (1) \"The Flying Bedstead\" (a short range craft Dallas and Parker use to repair the exterior of the ship), (2) a scene where they use the security cameras to spot the semi-molted alien that looks something like a cross between the chestburster and an egg with feet, (3) a scene at the end where the alien pulls Ripley out of the Narcissus with the harpoon cable and into space where she shoots it with a gun before getting back inside, and (4) Ridley Scott storyboarded a stowaway alien egg attached to the outside of the shuttle after Ripley destroys the first alien."], ["Did the _Alien_ (qv) rape Lambert?", "This is left ambiguous in the film, but many of the original ideas behind the _Alien_ (qv) had sexual undertones to make it much more unsettling. H.R. Giger's original design of the _Alien_ (qv) was much more sexual, but eventually he altered the design and used his original ideas for the film \"Species\". Ronald Schussett, one of the writers of the _Alien_ (qv) screenplay, had even stated the original idea of how to get the _Alien_ (qv) onto the ship would be \"the _Alien_ (qv) fucks him!\" and the whole idea behind the facehugger violating a man's mouth would add an extra layer of discomfort to male viewers. As for the \"rape\" scene, we see that Lambert is fully clothed when the _Alien_ (qv) corners her. We see the _Alien_ (qv) slowly creep its tail in between her legs and up to her back and although the scene then cuts away, we hear Lambert over the loud speaker as she gasps, convulses, and then give a final shriek of terror before silence. When Ripley finds the bodies of Parker and Lambert, we never see Lambert's full body but we see her legs dangling in the foreground, now undressed with blood running down them onto her feet, and her big toe has been broken and is bent out of shape. Exactly what the _Alien_ (qv) did to Lambert is left to the imagination of the individual viewer."], ["Can I read O'Bannon and Shusett's early script online?", "Yes.

However, Scott also stated that he never intended it to be that long, and that it was simply a version containing all the scenes from which he could start trimming the film. For the 25th anniversary of the movie, he created a new version (primarily by request of the producers and fans of the movie) which restores several deleted scenes, but also omits several minutes from the original cut to maintain the pacing of the movie.

Max faked his own death, disappeared into the vastness of America, took a new identity (Bailey), made it big in business in California using the million bucks he stole from the locker to presumably great effect as seed money and to grease the palms of politicians and underworld figures that assisted him with his career. Max' plan is hinted at before Max goes to Florida to vacation with Noodles -- as Frankie appears in the lobby downstairs as they leave alluding to Max's continued collusion without Noodle's knowledge. In faking his own death AND taking the entire sum despite having agreed that all the money is split equally amongst partners Max reveals the depths of his treachery since his plan involved the outright deaths of childhood friends Patsy, Cockeye, and Max had Noodles not been in the opium den when the mobsters came looking to assassinate him. When Noodles survives, Max still decides not to leave Noodles a cent, thereby consigning his childhood best friend to a bleak and penniless future on the run and likely filled with hardship at having to earn an honest living for the first time without a friend left or family he could return to.\n\nMeanwhile, Max was set for life ($1 million in 1933 would equivalent to over $17 million today), and after striking it rich investing in business, got into big-time politics, using his wealth to \"purchase\" (typically done through generous campaign contributions to a politician campaigning (and winning) the presidency) his position as Secretary of Commerce. Bailey also had a romantic relationship with Noodles' long time love interest, Deborah, with whom he had a son, David. Bailey essentially stole Noodles' life. After seeing his friends massacred during the liquor run he reported to the police, Noodles felt remorse but also knew he'd be hunted (shown at the opening of the film), so he fled the city & stayed away for 35 years in obscurity. Max/Bailey knew he was a marked man with his many corrupt influences unraveling in public scandal, so he thought it appropriate that Noodles do the honors and kill him."], ["What is the book Noodles reads as a kid when he's in the bathroom?", "Martin Eden by Jack London. Why he has to retrieve it from a hook hanging outside the bathroom window is not fully explained but chances are he was trying to hide it from his parents and any other adults (the bathrooms of poor NYC tenements were communal in the early 1900s, and each floor had one) who may have thought the book was objectionable. The book is about a sailor from a working class background who is infatuated with a woman from an upper middle class family. The book's theme is significant because Noodles' himself comes from a very poor background while the girl he loves, Deborah, comes from a slightly more privileged family, i.e., he's a street kid who joins his friend in committing crimes while she's the daughter of a successful Jewish delicatessen owner."], ["Were Max, Patsy, and Cockeye killed during Max' planned heist of the Federal Reserve Bank?", "No, they were making a last liquor run before Prohibition would be repealed.

When the gang are going to make a last liquor run the night of the big party, Noodles tips the police about the run, partly at Carol's (Max' girlfriend) request so that Max can rethink the idea -- if Max, Patsy, and Cockeye are arrested and thrown in jail, Max will have some time to reconsider raiding the Fed Reserve. However, everyone is killed by the police when Max bursts out of the truck & begins shooting at the police, which is not shown on screen but is told to Noodles by Carol years later."], ["What was the significance of the garbage truck outside of Mr. Bailey's house?", "Noodles took notice of the garbage truck parked at on a residential street in the middle of the night, as it was a bit out of place. After Noodles refuses to kill Bailey/Max, he leaves the house and the garbage truck starts up. Noodles freezes, moments later Max appears outside and the garbage truck drives away, Noodles stands fixated at the back of the garbage truck as it pulls away. This is because he suspected the garbage truck contained hitmen who would have killed him and stuffed him in the back. This was heavily supported by the appearance by Max. Max ordered the hitmen to kill Noodles once he had killed Max and exited the building but as the truck starts up Max appears, presumably to wave off the hitmen from icing Noodles, and as the trucks emergency blinkers go on just as Max appears before leaving again while the truck obscures him from our sight. Another theory is that after Noodles turned down Max's request to kill him, he commits suicide by jumping into the back of the garbage truck although this is not supported by the evidence of what is seen in the garbage truck as it's driving off. There is no blood or chewed up carcass as Noodles is seen doing a double take scrutinizing the contents of the truck for any sign that Max had in fact jumped in."], ["Why does Noodles smile in the Chinese opium den, as shown at the end of the film?", "At the end of the movie, after Noodles takes a long draw on the pipe in the Chinese opium den, he rolls onto his back and thinks intently for a few minutes before he breaks into a smile. The movie ends this way, frozen on his smiling face, which remains on the screen for over four minutes as the credits begin to roll, implying that this smile is very significant. The \"canonical interpretation\" is that the smile is just a result of Noodles getting high on the drugs he was smoking and that it indicates that the events following this (e.g., the things that happened in the 1960s) could be interpreted as a hallucination. This interpretation is supported by comments made by the director in a 1987 interview with No\u00ebl Simsolo.\n\nAt this point in the story, Noodles did not yet know that he had been betrayed to the mob nor that his girlfriend has been killed nor that the gang's money had been stolen by Max. He has just come from the scene of the shootout and crash where he has seen the three dead bodies labeled as his friends. Assuming that the post-opium-den scenes are not merely hallucinations, one alternative theory is that Noodles had recognized that the body tagged as Max's was not actually Max. His facial expression as he viewed the body indicates some sort of realization, but it is unclear what. If so, he could have been smiling because he saw the beauty of Max's plan to escape and start a new life, therefore, Noodles' realization is that he had succeeded in his goal of saving Max's life. Noodles may not yet have realized that Max betrayed him, Cockeye, and Patsy. In addition to Noodles' facial expression at the scene of the crime, this interpretation is also supported by the fact that Noodles does not show surprise at the end of the movie when he discovers that Max is still alive as well as by the \"story\" that Noodles tells Max at the end about his dear friend who was killed. In the story, Noodles says that his friend \"wanted it that way\" implying that he knew that Max had wanted to be thought of as dead.\n\nStill another alternate theory is that Noodles smiles because he realizes that he is now free of the gang in which he has been increasingly becoming an outsider and yet felt too loyal to ever leave on his own. This sense of separation is emphasized by the scene at the mock wake the gang held for Prohibition in which the other three gang members share a toast together whereas Noodles sits apart and only half-heartedly toasts with Max when they notice him not participating. It is also supported by the conversation on the beach in Florida between Max and Noodles where, before Max can relate his plan to rob the Federal Reserve, Noodles suggests that he has some ideas for some things they can do now that Prohibition is ending, which Max ignores. It is unclear whether Noodles' ideas involve continuing to operate as criminals, but it seems plausible at that point that they do not."], ["Why did Leone linger on Patsy eating the Charlotte Russe for so long?", "Patsy bought the pastry with the intention of giving it to Peggy in exchange for sex. Peggy mentioned earlier to Noodles that she'd allow Noodles to have sex with her if he gave her the dessert. Patsy probably heard that fact from Noodles. The reason we watch Patsy for so long is that the payoff of Patsy eating the dessert is far better than sex with Peggy.

The first version, 269 minutes long, was trimmed down by Leone himself - 40 minutes of footage were cut out. Since this version has a runtime of 251 minutes, it is probably not the complete first version by Leone, which was mentioned above. Additionally, the runtime which is displayed on the cover (246 minutes) is not correct. In comparison to the European theatrical version the extended version is \"only\" 22 minutes longer (one minute originates from additional credits regarding the restoration). There's a sticker on the Italian DVD which says \"include 26 Minute inediti\" - another thing that is simply wrong. One could have expected that a few scenes from the theatrical version were cut out, especially the short flashback of Noddles at the end of the movie before he makes his decision, since it was rumored that Leone was not satisfied with the scene. This is not the case, the movie simply follows the original course of the theatrical version which now has 6 additional (blocks of) scenes.

Reading the clues from Henry's diary, Indy realizes that the 'penitant man' referred to in the first clue means that he must prostrate himself, which he does so just in time to duck two large saw blades. He almost falters at the second trap when he realizes that he must step only on the stones that spell out God's name (Jehovah) until he remembers that the first letter in Latin is actually 'I (not 'J').

She chooses an ornate gold one, he drinks from it, and promptly dies. 'He chose poorly,' comments the Knight. Indy chooses a plain wooden cup, as would be made by a carpenter, and drinks from it. 'You have chosen wisely,' says the Knight, so Indy fills it with water and lets Henry drink from it. Henry is immediately cured, but Elsa grabs the cup for herself and tries to leave the temple, setting off a massive earthquake. Elsa and the cup fall into a fissure.

You can see the correct tile with the 'I' is actually bordering on the top-left side of the 'J' that Indy steps on. However, when he falls through, no column or support is seen anywhere close to him or underneath any tile within a 6 ft radius or so. Also, as Indy falls, he quickly grabs the ledges of the surrounding tiles. If only the correct tiles were supported, then many more tiles would have collapsed under the sudden force caused by his weight. Instead, watch closely when Indy steps on the 'O' and crushes the tile behind it; a metal pin can be seen inside the stone along the edge of the tile. The entire floor is probably reinforced with a metal framework, which keeps the floor together but allows individual parts of the floor to collapse.

It is perhaps for this purpose George Lucas and Steven Spielberg chose to focus on visual storytelling regardless of plot holes and inverted logic that force the audience to suspend disbelief, consciously or not. If the film were to adhere to the laws of logic, it would be impossible, so compromises had to be made to clarify the story without demanding too much of the audience's attention."], ["Did Elsa intentionally give Donovan the wrong Grail?", "Based on the script yes, but based on the movie no. While some would say yes because you can see Elsa becoming increasingly disturbed by Donovan's actions, before she chooses the cup on his behalf (particularly after the shoot-out with the Brotherhood of the Cruciform Sword and when Donovan shoots Henry Jones to ensure Indy's cooperation.) When Elsa chooses the cup she gives Donovan a quick smile, which looks very much forced, and is probably meant to give him a false sense of security that she will pick the correct Grail. Also, after she gives Donovan the cup, a gold chalice inlaid with jewels, she looks at Indy and subtly shakes her head. And when Donovan starts to feel sick from drinking from the wrong cup, her expression is not surprised at all, as if she thinks this is exactly what he deserves. When Indiana then starts to look for the genuine Grail, Elsa states that it would not be made out of gold, indicating that she had deliberately given Donovan the wrong cup. Some would say no because, when Elsa says (off-camera), that it would not be made out of gold, she asks this as a question. Her inflection is clear, which would indicate that even if she were unsure of what the Grail looked like, that she thought the Grail would be golden.\n\nMost likely, the intention of the writer Jeffrey Boam was to have Elsa deliberately give Donovan the wrong cup, since Boam's original script states - ELSA: It would not be made of gold. INDIANA JONES: That's the cup of a carpenter, (indicating the plainest of the chalices.) But actress 'Alison Doody' (qv) gives inflection in the 1989 movie, changing her statement to a question, and Director Steven Spielberg chose to keep this reading, which changes her intention to trying to choose correctly or at least not knowing for certain if she was choosing correctly. Likely Spielberg wanted to keep this open-ended, but this line stated as a question is too powerful to assume anything other than she didn't think that the Grail would be made of something other than gold."], ["Why did Indy give up the Holy Grail?", "At the heart-pounding hanging moment in the film where Indy is reaching for the grail, he stops because his father, for the first time in the entire movie, calls him \"Indiana,\" instead of \"Junior.\" Indy just got caught up in the moment of wanting the grail, which he didn't really seem to desire previously. Indy realized at the moment when his father called him \"Indiana\" that his own real search in the film was not for the holy grail, but for the relationship he'd always wanted with his father. It wouldn't have been worth it for Indy to have kept on striving for the grail just as the Nazis and Elsa had done and failed, risking his life and his father's; the grail just revealed each person's own greed."], ["Why didn't Dr Jones Sr want the Grail?", "For Dr Jones Sr the quest itself and the knowledge that the Grail actually existed was satisfying enough.

One sip won't make you immortal; you have to keep drinking from it. That would explain why the knights who left the cave after drinking from the Grail eventually died of extreme old age. Nothing in the film states that one becomes immortal by drinking from the Grail one time, and if that were the case, it would be difficult to explain those knights' deaths. The grail knight does say that the grail itself cannot pass beyond the great seal, for that is the price of immortality. The meaning is that, if you wish to be immortal, you have to stay in that cave for eternity with the grail. Therefore, they are not immortal. Additionally, we see in Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull that Henry Jones, Sr. has indeed passed away in the time since the events of Last Crusade."], ["What's going on at the Nazi rally Indy sneaks into?", "The Nazis often held public rallies as a way of garnering support for their cause.

Also much of Ofelia's fantasy concerns her powerful and ambivalent feelings towards her unborn sibling and her mother. I think even older children may well find both these things deeply unsettling.

However, the character was heavily influenced by Goya's painting 'Saturn Devouring his Son'. You can see the painting here: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:Saturno_devorando_a_sus_hijos.jpg\n\nCertain characteristics of the Pale Man may also have been partly inspired by German and Scandinavian folk tales, in which persons or monsters representing the dead (or being dead themselves) are usually portrayed as blind or at least very near-sighted, and often also as child-eaters."], ["After the warnings from the faun and seeing the murals around the hall, why would Ofelia still eat the grapes?", "Ofelia claims that she ate the two grapes because she didn't think they would be missed. One can draw certain parallels to the Greek myth of Persephone and the Biblical myth of the Garden of Eden. However, she appeared to be in a sort of trance with the forbidden fruit acting as a sort of a Siren's Song.\n\nSomething that may also have been of influence is that Ofelia was sent to bed without dinner the evening before as a punishment for ruining her dress and missing the dinner party. The hunger would have made her more susceptible to the \"Siren Song\" of the fruits displayed at the banquet. Moreover, given the level of rationing at the time, it may be possible that grapes were a luxury that Ofelia now misses.\n\nAlso, the fairies were trying to convince her to open the wrong door with the key. Therefore, she no longer trusted them and didn't believe that anything bad would happen if she ate any of the food. So she brushed the fairies away and ate the grapes.\n\nFurthermore, it could be said that Ofelia and her mother, while both in 'discomfort', were both eating from the 'same table'. One could say that Ofelia's mother was not happy with her relationship with the Captain. Nevertheless, although it harmed her soul, she was still attracted by all the pleasures that came along. Ofelia's eating the fruit can be seen as a metaphor for her mother eating at the 'same table' with someone that, at first, looked harmless; but, on further insight, turned out to be a monster.\n\nVarious speculations in this FAQ consider why a real person might act in this way, but the reason may have less to do with characterisation and more with genre convention. Anyone who knows European folktales (fairytales) will be familiar with the story structure being used here in which a hero (often a young princess) must complete a series of tasks (usually three) to win a prize. A familiar element of this is a dire warning to avoid some particular action (most often eating). Invariably the hero fails to heed such warnings, and it can be argued that del Toro is simply following the rules in having Ofelia do the same. However, characterisation in the original folktales is often very shallow, and some may feel that a serious movie with more careful characterisation, also requires more care with elements of this kind. Indeed to have Ofelia eat while standing with back firmly turned to a scary monster (which most real children would watch very carefully) raises the suspicion that plot and character logic may have been abandoned here simply for the sake of setting up the dramatic chase which follows.\n\nIn addition to all of the above, consider that the underlying theme of a great portion of the movie concerns obedience: Capitan Vidal is blindly obedient; the doctor specifically accuses him of such after refusing the captain's orders to save the tortured man. By contrast, the heroes of this film are the disobedient ones, and so it is only fitting, albeit quite confusing at first, that Ofelia should eat the grapes, even when clearly told not to. Aside from the fact that her doing so also creates quite a juicy (pun intended) moment of tension for the viewer, who is inwardly shouting \"Don't eat the grapes!\" (a tension that del Toro sets up very obviously by having Ofelia's back to the monster), it is also by having it so completely and perfectly obvious that she absolutely MUST be obedient that helps to very brilliantly underline this moment of pure disobedience on her part.\n\nAlso, it is important to remember the third task, in which not following the rules was the best answer: Ofelia passes the test by sparing her infant brother, at the cost of her own mortal life, though she had promised to obey the faun."], ["Was the fairy tale real, or in Ofelia's imagination?", "According to his interview with twitchfilm.net, Guillermo Del Toro said that the fantasy world isn't only Ofelia's imagination; the fantasy world does exist. In the ending, Ofelia does actually live in the world (where she would be more happy to live in than the real world).\n\nSource: http://twitchfilm.net/archives/008507.html\n\nA more subtle clue lies in the movie itself: After discovering that Ofelia knew the truth about Mercedes, Vidal has Ofelia locked in her room, and the guard stationed outside has orders to kill Ofelia first if anyone tries to come to her rescue. So if she didn't use the faun's magical chalk to create a door in the wall, how did Ofelia successfully leave her room and escape the notice of the guard? Her room had no windows for her to use, either."], ["Why didn't Mercedes kill Vidal when she had the chance?", "The answer is mainly in the knife she was using. It's just a paring knife and as such it is neither very big nor is it very sharp. Also, Mercedes is very frightened and wants to get out of there as quickly and quietly as possible. As such, she simply tries to incapacitate him long enough for her to make her escape.\n\nAs well, Mercedes had earlier spoke of her shame and cowardice for not killing the Captain given her easy access to him, so she must be ambivalent. At the moment of her best chance to act, even saying to the Captain: You won't be the first pig I've gutted, she relents. She knows how to slaughter farm animals with a simple gash across the shallow main arteries and windpipe in the neck, so she must have decided that mutilating his face (after first slicing his back and stabbing his upper chest) would give her what she needs most then, her escape so that she may save others, not only her self.\n\n[spoiler]In the final test Ofelia passes (sparing her infant brother though it costs her own mortal life); we learn a truly moral person must never shed innocent blood when ones own blood might do. We may see Mercedes actions when she had a chance to kill Captain Vidal as perhaps more heroic, certainly more ambiguous and thus more grown-up than even Ofelias sparing of her own infant brother. Given that the Captains actions throughout the film are far from innocent (apparently guided by sadistic cruelty, vanity and a death wish to follow his fathers death in battle,) Mercedes decision to spare his life (at least then) could be highest among the ethical highpoints of the film.

In 2004 Del Toro said:\n\"Pan is an original story. Some of my favorite writers (Borges,\nBlackwood, Machen, Dunsany) have explored the figure of the god Pan and\nthe symbol of the labyrinth.

In fact, it could be argued that all three tests are designed to prove that she is the opposite of Vidal's character.\n\nIt has also been suggested that, in many fairytales involving a choice among three things, two will be made of some nice material, such as silk or metal, and one of a cheaper, less impressive material. The correct choice is, of course, the cheaper less impressive material. The three doors, from left to right, seem to be made of wood, some sort of metal, and another type of metal.

This is beneficial to the recipient, so that if the bond is ever lost, stolen, or destroyed, it can be replaced by the issuer at no loss. Bearer bonds are not issued to anyone in particular and are therefore more like blank checks. If they are lost or stolen there is no recovery possible, as there is no record kept of the original owner. Anyone who has physical possession of a bearer bond is free to redeem it, which makes them very tempting targets for thieves. In the early 1980s the U.S. Government made issuance of bearer bonds illegal, as their use made it much easier for drug lords and organized crime to conduct their illegal activity, hide their assets, and avoid paying their taxes."], ["How did Hans know that those kids on TV were Holly McClane's?", "Holly told Hans that she wasn't married, but he can clearly see the pictures of her children on the desk.

At the end, we see Theo, one of the terrorists, driving an ambulance out of the terrorists' truck while wearing a paramedic's uniform.

De Souza, is that the terrorists were supposed to be shown wearing and synchronizing the same type of watch in the beginning of the movie. After killing a couple of terrorists, John McClane started to notice the watches, so when Hans handed John a cigarette, John saw the watch on Hans' wrist, which tipped him off. However, due to some script changes during the shooting of the movie, the scene of the terrorists synchronizing their watches was dropped, leaving this clue unaddressed to the viewer. That, of course, does not rule out that John still identified Hans as one of the terrorists by his watch. Another logical explanation is that John simply recognized Gruber's voice. John was hiding on the roof of the elevator in the beginning, where he could hear Gruber's distinct voice quite well, and later he had several conversations with him over the radio. And even if John did not recognize the voice, he may have just been overly careful, since giving a gun to a stranger in this sort of situation is after all very risky. Gruber's pseudonym of Bill Clay appearing on the staff board is a reason to trust him, although there are a few subtle reasons to raise suspicion. Even if Gruber was actually an escaped hostage, John may have expected him to hide somewhere, instead of wandering around. John may have been observing for a moment as Hans was checking on the explosives, which is certainly suspicious behavior, before approaching him. John probably knew from the beginning that Hans was one of the hostage takers, but decided to humor him to see how Hans would try to trick him."], ["What kind of handgun does John McClane use in the movie?", "The Beretta 92F, a common handgun also used by the US Armed Forces since 1985.

Taking Holly with him, Gruber then goes down to the vault to get the bonds. McClane climbs up to the roof and warns the hostages that they're going to be killed if they stay there, shooting his gun into the air to scare them, so everyone starts going downstairs. Unfortunately, the FBI helicopter mistakes McClane for one of the terrorists and starts shooting at him. Suddenly the roof explodes in flames, taking out the helicopter as well. McClane gets off the roof by tying himself to a firehose and jumping off the building. He then breaks the glass in a window and swings himself inside. He meets up with Gruber who is holding a gun to Holly's head. Gruber orders McClane to put down his gun, which he does, but when Gruber thinks that he's in control of the situation, McClane whips out a gun that he had taped to his back, shoots one of the remaining terrorists and wounding Gruber. Gruber falls backwards and out of a window, almost taking Holly with him. McClane releases Holly's wristwatch (to which Gruber was clinging), and Gruber falls to his death. Meanwhile, Argyle ('De'voreaux White' (qv)) crashes his limo into Theo's van (it's disguised as an ambulance), preventing him from getting away with the bonds. McClane and Holly leave the building together, and McClane and Officer Powell ('Reginald VelJohnson' (qv)) meet face-to-face for the first time. Karl comes out of the building armed with a gun.

This would then give the terrorists the opportunity to find them and kill or kidnap them -- at least, that's the reason she gives in the second movie. Also, Dick threatened Holly's babysitter (or nanny) with contacting the INS (Immigration & Naturalization Service) to gain entry to the house as well -- VERY unethical for a news reporter. On the other hand, Dick's actions caused Gruber to take Holly hostage and made the situation more difficult and dangerous for John by giving Hans that much leverage. The daughter also answers Dick's question,\"is there something you would like to say to them (parents) if they're watching?\" This tells Gruber that Holly's husband is also there at the tower and that he is likely John McClane, which is why he turns over the picture to verify it.

In 2000, in an interview with Richard Jobson of the Manchester Guardian, Besson stated \"I was happy with the first one, it was mine, my director's cut, no one asked me to cut it.\" He also explains why he made the extended cut for the first time in 1996;  At the same time you still have 25 minutes that nobody has seen.

Besson further elaborates on why the longer version was released in Japan; \"So we had like five screens and people loved it and sent their friends and then the Japanese called and said: \"We want the long version, please.

It should be understood that Dicken's novel deals with one of the most important events in history, the French Revolution. Bane's 'revolution' is fake, and is only supported by a small proportion of Gotham's populace; the rest appear to go into hiding, including the deputy police commissioner, Foley. The behaviour of the majority mirrors that of the Gothamites in the 'ferry scene' in 'The Dark Knight'; the citizens vote to blow up the boat with the prisoners on it, while the prison warder cravenly gives the detonator to one of the prisoners to do the same to the citizens, instead of throwing it out of the window like he should have done. It would have been a brave choice for the writer/director to portray a Gotham where the entire population actually did 'rise' as in 'A Tale of Two Cities', putting Batman on the 'wrong' side of the argument as he struggles to defeat a genuine citizens revolution. Batman would appear to be on the right politically, and has even been labelled a fascist at times, so a movie that explores this would have been a very interesting take on the Dark Knight myth. In conclusion, in my humble opinion TDKR is as much based on the Dicken's classic as Star Trek: First Contact is based on 'Moby Dick'."], ["Should I watch the other Batman movies to understand this one?", "Someone who watches _The Dark Knight Rises_ (qv) first should be able to follow the overall story. However, there are many story references to the first two films. Important story elements like why Batman is in seclusion, who Harvey Dent was and what he did, and who Ra's Al Ghul and the League of Shadows are, will not be understood by someone who has not seen the two movies before this one."], ["Why did Bruce Wayne retire as Batman before the events of the film?", "He retired because he wasn't needed anymore after taking the fall for Harvey Dent. He told Gordon in the hospital dialogue, that \"The Batman wasn't needed anymore. We won.\" This is because the goal of Batman was to be a symbol that inspired people to fight Gotham's criminal and corrupt, as stated Batman Begins. Since most of the cops were corrupt, Batman had to do this by vigilante means. Batman did this by waging war on organized crime--the root of the criminal and corrupt.\n\nBy The Dark Knight, he inspired both the copycat vigilantes and Harvey Dent to fight the criminal and corrupt. Bruce preferred the latter over the former as he told Alfred that \"[the vigilantes] weren't what I had in mind when I wanted to inspire people\". Bruce believes that Harvey was \"the first legitimate ray of light in decades\" and \"the symbol of hope I could never be\", since Harvey was using legal means to fight the criminal and corrupt and his prosecution managed to what Bruce called \"lock up half of the cities criminals [without wearing a mask]\". Since already 549 of the 1000 criminals were now locked up--allowing what Dent called \"18 months of clean streets\" for the 549 criminals was the whole mob (Lau, the mob's last money launder, when talking to the mobs, said \"everyone's money would be at stake\" for the mob laundered all their money to him; but he surrendered all his clients to Dent), Batman was soon not needed as the police can easily handle the remaining street criminals. Also, The Dark Knight further explains the temporary nature of Batman; Natacha in the dinner scene mentions \"Gotham needs elected officials like you, not one who thinks he is above the law. Bruce then agrees by saying \"exactly\". But then Harvey, believing in vigilantism, said, \"Who appointed the batman? We did. All of us who stood by and led scum take control of our city\". But Rachel said, \"But this is a democracy, Harvey.\" Harvey then said, \"When their enemies were at the gates, the Romans would suspend democracy and appoint one man to protect the city. It was not considered an honor, it was considered a public service.\" So, when a enemy, like organized crime or a terrorist, is attacking Gotham, there must be a suspension of democracy since only a vigilante like Batman can effectively beat it. But, Rachel rebutted with, \"Harvey, the last man to be appointed to protect the republic was named Caesar and he never gave up his power.\" So, after Batman defeats organized crime, he must give up his power or else he will be corrupt. Harvey then agrees with this and said, \"Fine you either die a hero or live long enough to see yourself become a villain\". And since Batman indirectly defeated organized crime by having Harvey's prosecution lock up the whole mob, Bruce then honors what Harvey said by telling Rachel in the Penthouse party that he was going to retire soon.\n\nBut then the mob leaders used bail to get out of jail and hire Joker, who then caused Harvey to go on a killing spree. According to Gordon, because of Dent's murdering spree, \"All of Harvey's prosecutions, everything he fought for...undone.\" The mayor warned Harvey that in 18 months of jail, the mob would try to use any dirt on Harvey to undo his prosecution during the appeal process. Thus, if the \"criminals can get anything on [Harvey], they would be back on the streets.\" Batman reiterated the same thing to Dent after he caught him interrogating the insane man in the dark alley. Plus, according to Joker, if the people of Gotham find out about his murdering spree, they would \"[lose] their minds\". That would probably create freaks like the Joker. So, Batman had to sacrifice his reputation to keep the prosecution and to keep Gotham's sanity. Since no one knew of Harvey's crimes, the mob would fail at appeal and not leave jail. With the whole mob in jail, half the mob's money burned, mob bosses dead--leaving the mobsters vulnerable and eliminating financial incentives for cop corruption--and the Joker captured, the remaining criminals on the streets would have trouble rebuilding the organized crime machine and would be arrested if they tried so. And with the Dent Act eliminating parole, the mob is locked up for good along with any additional criminals later arrested, thus deterring organized crime from bouncing back.\n\nIn conclusion, by inspiring Dent, the whole mob was jailed under his prosecution, then jailed for good--eliminating organized crime--under the Dent Act. Thus, Batman was no longer needed and Bruce could retire. Some viewers might note that The Dark Knight suggested Batman couldn't retire since Joker told Batman in their last encounter \"I think you am I are destined to [fight each other] forever\". However, Batman rebutted him by saying \"You'll be locked up in a padded cell forever\". Joker then said \"Maybe we can share it\". Thus, this suggests Joker would be locked up forever since he admitted to it. Also, some viewers might think Gordon saying \"we will hunt him because he can take it\" means he can't retire. Yet, in the 3rd film's hospital scene, Gordon seemed confused that Batman retired since he said \"we were in this together. . . and then you were gone\" He apparently misunderstood what Batman told him earlier of \"you will hunt me. . .because that needs to happen\". Batman meant to chase him that night so he can be viewed as a criminal, not for him to keep fighting crime. Otherwise, he helping capture any remaining criminals will bring suspicion to the public and cops that Gordon framed Batman, cause chase scenes on him so criminals would escape like what happened with the stock heist chase, and undermine Dent's martyring that inspired the public and cops to change for the better to fix the city."], ["What exactly happened to Bruce Wayne in the eight years between films? Did Bruce and Batman disappear the same night?", "After Batman tells Commissioner Gordon to pin Harvey Dent's crimes on him, Bruce Wayne hangs up cape and cowl and ceases to be Batman. But Bruce didn't disappear after that. After The Dark Knight, Bruce Wayne tried to move on by becoming a billionaire philanthropist, using the Wayne Foundation to fund Dent Day and charities like Saint Swithen's orphanage along with, according to Lucius in the office scene, \"[funneling] the entire [Wayne Enterprise] R and D budget for five years into a fusion project that [he] then mothball[s]\". The project resulted in the creation of a brand new, unique fusion reactor which was labelled as the first real hope for humanity to have a sustainable source of energy. But, Bruce then mothballed it three years before _The Dark Knight Rises_ (qv); according to Miranda in the reactor scene, \"three years ago a Russian scientist published a paper on weaponized fusion reactions.\" Upon learning this, Bruce feared that someone could turn the reactor into a bomb and effectively destroy Gotham with it. So, Miranda said, \"One week later [Bruce claimed that the] reactor started developing problems..\" Miranda in the charity ball told Bruce that he \"[spent] half his fortune on a plan to save [the world with the fusion reactor]... And isn't so wounded when it fails that he goes into hiding...\" Thus, after he gave up on the project, Bruce felt that he had nothing else left in the world and locked himself away in Wayne Manor, becoming a recluse, waiting for things to go bad in Gotham in the hopes of once again becoming Batman and having a purpose in life, or as Alfred suggests, a reason to die. In conclusion, Bruce was active as a philanthropist and investor for 5 years, and became a recluse for 3 years."], ["Why did the CIA not check the identity of the three men before bringing them on the plane?", "The CIA didn't check because they didn't know Barsad ('Josh Stewart' (qv)), the driver who turned the hooded men in, was actually working for Bane. Barsad is shown to be Bane's right hand man throughout the movie. The fact that Barsad speaks with an Uzbekistani accent in this scene and an English one throughout the rest of the movie indicates that he was using a false identity to fool the CIA. And it seems Bane had Barsad work with the CIA, since Barsad told the CIA man when he asked why he brought the kidnapped men, Barsad said \"Don't worry, no charge for [the kidnapped men]\" and that \"[Bane's men] were trying to claim your prize\". So, the CIA already trusted Barsad - assuming the CIA must trust someone before hiring, say Barsad."], ["How old is Bruce Wayne/Batman supposed to be in this film? How long was Bruce Wayne as Batman?", "The climax of Batman Begins happens on the eve of Bruce Wayne's 30th birthday. The Dark Knight was said to have taken place roughly six to nine months later. and _The Dark Knight Rises_ (qv) takes place eight years after The Dark Knight. Five months pass within the film (11 if you count the prologue taking place six months before the remainder of the film). Therefore Bruce is 38 and likely turns 39 at some point. Bruce was Batman for one year before The Dark Knight, since the Joker in The Dark Knight said, \"Let's wind the clocks back a year\" to the mobsters when he was referring to how, a year ago, Batman wasn't there and the legal system was still entirely in the mobs' hands."], ["Why is Bruce Wayne in such terrible physical shape at the beginning of the film?", "Being Batman is a physically demanding job, Bruce Wayne had been shot, stabbed, beaten, set on fire, gassed by weaponized hallucinogens, fallen from extreme heights, bitten by dogs, survived explosions, crashes, etc. While the Batsuit would offer him some protection, the physical trauma he had sustained would certainly take its toll on his body. As we see at the beginning of The Dark Knight, Bruce had several scars over his body and he had only been Batman for a year. In this film, 8 years have passed and Bruce has been locked away in seclusion for 3 years before the 3rd film. If he didn't stay in top shape, the previous injuries to his body would likely start taking their toll. i.e. not exercising joints can worsen arthritis; since he damaged much of his cartilage in his left knee from falling in the end of the 2nd film and wasn't physically active that last 3 years, the pain grew and caused him to use a cane."], ["Is the Harvey Dent's eulogy scene at the beginning of the movie a new shot or is it unused footage from \"The Dark Knight\"?", "In the very first moments of the film, there is a scene where Commissioner Gordon ('Gary Oldman' (qv)) reads a eulogy about Harvey Dent. The setting is identical to a scene featured in The Dark Knight but in a different camera view and with different lines. It is not known if the setting was recreated for the new movie in order to seem identical or if it is unused footage from the previous movie. In the original script, though, there is an extended version where this scene is directly connected to the previous movie. That may indicate that they had shot an extended version of this scene in The Dark Knight and that, in the final cut of the film, this shot was left out with the additional 'deleted' footage, featured in _The Dark Knight Rises_ (qv)."], ["Does Harvey Dent appear in this film?", "'Aaron Eckhart' (qv) expressed interest in reprising the role of Harvey \"Two-Face\" Dent, but Christopher Nolan has stated that the character is dead. Dent does appear in a flashback to the ending of The Dark Knight. Also, a holiday was declared in his honor, \"Harvey Dent Day\", which has been celebrated for up to eight years. The cover-up of Dent's crimes also plays a part in Bane's scheme to take over Gotham. In addition, the Gotham government also implements the \"Dent Act\" ad memoriam to the District Attorney's legacy, which denied all prisoners incarcerated in Blackgate Penitentiary access to parole. Bane completely destroys Harvey Dent's legacy by revealing the truth of Dent's crimes to the city. He then tears up a picture of Harvey Dent and reads a written statement by Commissioner Gordon."], ["What is the \"Dent Act\" mentioned in the movie?", "The Dent Act is a law honoring the late Harvey Dent for his commitment to rid Gotham of organized crime. The act is implied to have many anti-organized crime measures, since the mayor said it gave police the \"teeth\" it needed against the mob. But, John Blake to tell us it's most important aspect: there is absolutely no possibility of parole: \"These men, locked up in Blackgate for eight years, denied parole under the Dent Act. . .\" Gordon tells Blake that rules like parole \"aren't weapons anymore, they're shackles, letting the bad get ahead\". Without parole, the criminals are forced to serve their full sentence (i.e. 20 years under a RICO case) instead of taking advantage of parole and going on a crime spree again. This part of the act probably came from the fact the mob leaders in the previous film used the similar method of bail to get out of jail and use the Joker to cause chaos in Gotham. The act eliminated organized crime and corruption by denying parole so criminals are locked up for good--discouraging any further organized crime; this was made easier, since Dent's prosecution already cleaned the streets. Blake reminds the audience of this by saying to Gordon, \"When you and Dent cleaned the streets you cleaned 'em good.\" The mob laundered all their money to Lau since he said Dent \"put all of [his] competitors out of business\" and that the police \"identified the mob's banks. . and were planning to cease your funds\"; so, he said \"everyone's money is at stake\" if the police leverages one of them. Lau was leveraged and gave Gordon all his clients--the mobsters--and Dent used RICO to prosecute all 549 of them; Dent got away with locking up 549 of the 1000 criminals in Gotham since the mayor said \"the public likes you. . . that's the only reason this might fly\". Locking up all of Gotham's mobsters caused irreparable damage to the organized crime machine so the police can easily handle the remaining street criminals; thus why Dent told the mayor he will have \"18 months of clean streets\". And the reason why he said 18 months is since after that time, the mayor said the mob would \"kick [his] ass with appeals\" and will try to win them by \"get[ting] anything on [Dent]\" so \"[these] criminals would be back on the streets\". Since Batman hid Harvey's crimes, the mob failed at appeal and are stuck in jail and got denied parole. With half of the mob's money burned, the mob left leaderless from Joker's arrest and the 3 mob leaders dead--destroying links between corrupt law enforcement and Maroni--and the mobsters already locked up, the remaining street criminals would have difficultly trying to rebuild and commit organized crime and be arrested if they try so. And since Gordon said \"there are a thousand inmates in Blackgate Prison. . .violent criminals, essential cogs in the organized crime machine\", that means the remaining 500 criminals tried to reinvigorate organized crime but got arrested, jailed, and denied parole."], ["How did Blake know where to find the washed up Gordon from the sewer catchment basin?", "He knew where to find Gordon because he already found a washed up body at the catchment basin before. Earlier in the film, Blake is called to the basin by a DWP man to investigate the dead body of a teenager lying in the water. The DWP man tells him \"[bodies] wash up a couple times a month [at the basin].\" Then, Blake found out the teenager was from his old orphanage and he and other outgrown orphans came to the sewers to find work in the recession. Thus, Blake assumed since many bodies watched up at the basin, Gordon would too."], ["What song is played in the background during the dance scene between Bruce Wayne and Selina Kyle?", "'Pavane pour une infante d\u00e9funte' (Pavane for a Dead Princess) by Maurice Ravel."], ["How did Blake know Bruce Wayne is Batman?", "In his first conversation with Bruce, Blake reveals that he was also an orphan who watched his father's murder and that he understands what that does to a kid, how he, like Bruce, was trapped in his anger. He told Bruce, \"You gotta learn to hide the anger--practice smiling in the mirror--It's like putting on a mask.\" Blake recounts a visit Bruce made to the orphanage where Blake grew up. Blake tells Bruce, \"We were so excited. Bruce Wayne --billionaire orphan! I mean, we use to make up stories about you, man. Legends. And to the other kids, you know, it's was all that was --just stories, but. . .\" So, since he was \"Bruce Wayne, billionaire orphan\", the awed orphans thought Bruce was Batman and made up stories and legends about it (i.e. Bruce Wayne is Batman because he is rich, Bruce Wayne is Batman because he is out to avenge his parents, etc.) The orphans liked Batman, since they are, after all, kids--shown by the orphan Blake talks to who draws bat symbols. But to the other kids, Bruce's happy-go-lucky persona did not fit Batman's angry nature--thus, the idea that Bruce is Batman was only just a story to them. But, when Blake saw though Bruce's face, he saw it as more than a story. The moment Blake laid eyes on Billionaire Bruce stepping out of a fancy car with a supermodel on his arm: \"Right when I saw you, I knew who you really were. I'd seen that look on your face before. It's the same one I learned myself.\" Blake knows that the \"eccentric billionaire\" is a mask that hides Bruce's true angry nature, making the stories as true."], ["How did Gordon know who Bane was if his name wasn't stated to him in the sewer?", "Bane is a well-known international terrorist and mercenary. The CIA had wanted him for his terrorist actions and Bane is infamous as the terrorist that has \"[n]ever been seen or photographed without a mask.\" According to Alfred, who checked the name Bane for Bruce, \"[Bane was] behind a coup in West Africa that secured mining operations for our friend John Daggett\". So, a Gothamite taking economic advantage of a nation that was attacked by an infamous terrorist would be controversial to Gothamites like Gordon who always is looking out for bad things among Gotham even in what a congressman in the Dent Day ceremony called \"peacetime\"; Blake, when he was with Gordon on police headquarter's rooftop, said Gordon's mentality is \"[l]ike we're still at war\" even after he cleaned the streets 8 years ago. So Gordon would already be familiar with Bane."], ["What was the laptop/tablet hybrid device featured during the Stock Exchange sequence?", "It is speculated to be the Dell XPS Duo 12"], ["How did Bane and his men get the motorcycles into the Stock Exchange building?", "We don't see Bane enter the building, but when he approaches the metal detector, he is still wearing his motorcycle helmet and a jacket of a delivery company. We can assume that Bane was posing as a delivery man and usually delivery orders come through the back entrance of a building. Thus, the motorcycles were from the back entrance of the building. Then, after Bane took the exchange hostage, his men could have easily took the bikes in before the police arrived. Also, even if that didn't happen, considering his men worked as the maintenance and operators of the exchange, they could have previously snuck the bikes in when the building was closed."], ["Why did it go day to night suddenly in the motorcycle chase?", "The day to night shift seems to be a continuity error. Nevertheless, if the audience watches the scenes closely, the sky in each scene gets darker as it cuts to each other --thus, we can assume the motorcycle chase was longer than shown."], ["What was the gun-like device Batman was using during the chase scene in the streets? Why did the lights in the tunnel shut down?", "The rifle was presumably an EMP blaster that he aimed at the motorcycle to prevent it from getting away. EMP weapons can send out a large burst of electrical energy, overwhelming targeted electronic devices; generally, simpler circuits like lights will be temporarily disabled, while more complicated circuits will be fried and completely disabled. The EMP blaster is shown to have completely disabled two motorcycles. Batman also used some EMP device in his belt to temporarily disable the lights in the tunnel and later in Bane's layer. Bruce Wayne uses EMP also when he completely disabled the paparazzi cameras when he arrives at the ball, and when he gave Gordon the Bat's EMP cannon mount to block and completely disable the trigger's connection device to the bomb later in the film."], ["How does Bane differ from the Batman & Robin film and the comics?", "Batman & Robin portrayed Bane very differently than other versions of Batman. In it, he was reduced to being a mindless henchman. In the comics, Bane was of Caribbean descent and uses a drug called \"venom\" to create his massive hulking size. The mask he wears feeds the venom directly into his brain. Bane is a highly intelligent, mostly self-educated, a cunning strategist and a skilled fighter. In _The Dark Knight Rises_ (qv), Bane is very similar to his comic book counterpart. One key difference is that he does not use venom. His mask holds an anesthetic to keep chronic pain at bay, which was caused by severe spinal and facial trauma. Also, Bane, while still very muscular and formidable, is a much more realistic size: His height is only about 6'2\" and he weighs approximately 240 pounds. Most notably different is Bane's accent; 'Tom Hardy' (qv), who plays Bane, says, \"The choice of the accent is actually a man called Bartley Gorman, who was a bare knuckle fighter, a Romani gypsy, which I wanted to underpin the Latin -- but a Romani Latin opposed to Latino. His particular accent is very specific, which was a gypsy accent. So that's why it was difficult to understand. But once you tune into it, you get it, I hope.\""], ["How does Bane eat and/or drink?", "It was not explained in the film, but he may have some sort of mechanism that allows him to suck in liquefied nutrients through his mask. It's also possible that he simply removes the mask while eating, and endures the pain. He may also inject himself with painkillers before taking off the mask. There may also be a nose piece on the mask or a separate one that he can detach and connect to the mask so he can still breathe in the anesthetic through his nose while leaving his mouth free to eat and drink. Bane might also have developed a technique or had been instructed in one that would allow him to temporarily wean himself off the pain medication before removing the mask, say, by lowering the dosage in the minutes before he would remove it, so he could take care of daily habits like shaving or eating. There might also be control settings on the mask that allowed him to do this as well. Some viewers believe that Bane felt a sudden shock of pain after Batman damages his mask, while others interpreted Bane's reaction more akin to panic of trying to fix the mask before the pain set in. A few seconds after Batman damages the mask, Bane is able to throw Batman against a column and deliver a few more blows. Two of them don't connect & he punches the column, perhaps reinforcing the idea that the pain hadn't set in yet & begun to cripple him."], ["How old is Bane supposed to be?", "The flashbacks set in the Pit are roughly 20 years before the events of Batman Begins, and it is assumed that Bane was in his late teens to early twenties. This would put Bane somewhere roughly between 40 and 50 (counting the approximate nine months between Batman Begins and The Dark Knight, as well as the eight years in between The Dark Knight and _The Dark Knight Rises_ (qv)) during the events of this film, although this is speculation because we are never told the ages of other parties involved."], ["Was the gas mask that was attached to Bane feeding him \"venom\" or simply a breathing apparatus?", "Technically neither. In the film, the prisoner who looks after Bruce tells how the blind prisoner in the next cell was once the prison's doctor, but also a morphine addict. Bane was attacked and severely wounded. (And because of his spinal scar and back brace that we see in the scene where Gordon is brought to Bane, we know Bane's spine was severely injured and he had cervical fusion surgery) The doctor did what he could to save Bane, but with his addiction he botched the surgery, leaving Bane in constant chronic pain. The mask Bane wears \"keeps the pain at bay,\" as Bruce's prison caretaker says, so it holds an anesthetic (probably morphine) likely stored on his back brace or in his flak vest. The mask may also hold small compartments in the back of the mask in case he needs to remove the vest. There is no mention of \"venom\" in the film, though the anesthetic could be nicknamed thus. Bane simply keeps himself in excellent shape. There is an interesting article where actual medical professionals are consulted and asked how Bane's mask may work in the real world: here."], ["How does Bane learn Batman's true identity and did the original League survive?", "Bane was part of the League of Shadows - the same organization Bruce was - and so if Bane and Talia took over the League of Shadows after Ra's al Ghul's death, they would have learned this from existing members. In the sewer fight, Bane knows that Bruce betrayed the League; he wouldn't know this unless the League members informed him. Plus, in the judicial hall scene, Talia mentioned Bruce \"murdered\" her father; so that means the League members that were with Ra's in their previous Gotham attack survived and escaped and informed her. We neither see nor hear dialogue about the League after Ra's death in the 1st film; that is because the League members escaped and survived. This is confirmed with Alfred telling Bruce \"Who leads them now?\" in their conversation about the League in this 3rd film. And the League consists of mercenary members originally too since in Batman Begins, when Bruce first enters the temple, we see some League members holding assault weapons and wearing colored scarfs. Likewise, we see similarly dressed and armed League members descending the pit in the flashback scene in _The Dark Knight Rises_ (qv)."], ["What state is Gotham City located in?", "It has never been stated directly in this trilogy, but all of the license plates say \"Gotham\" on them, so it would stand to reason that it is located in the state of Gotham, because license plates have the name of the state and not the city on them. However, in the first two movies, which were filmed in Chicago, the plates had Illinois-style designs just in case Illinois plates slipped through in the background."], ["What was the purpose of the plane scene and the blood transfusion?", "The purpose of the scene is to allow Bane to fake Dr. Pavel's death so he can later secretly use him to turn the fusion reactor into a bomb. Dr. Pavel was in talks with both Bane's men and the CIA before the events of the movie, since Bane said on the plane \"Dr. Pavel refused our offer in favor of [the CIA's]\". Thus, Bane \"had to find out what [Dr. Pavel] told [the CIA interrogator]\". So, Bane had Barsad, shown to be Bane's right hand man throughout the movie, kidnap him and two others and bring Dr. Pavel to the CIA. The driver, Barsad, was working with the CIA secretly for Bane, since when the CIA interrogator asked why he brought the kidnapped men, Barsad said \"Don't worry, no charge for [the kidnapped men]\" and that \"[Bane's men] were trying to claim your prize\". This prize is assumed to be Dr. Pavel, since the CIA is trying to save him from Bane. So, during the plane scene, Bane killed the CIA on board and then had to fake Dr. Pavel's death so the CIA would no longer worry about Dr. Pavel's whereabouts. Bane transfused Dr. Pavel's blood into the lookalike corpse (that is pale and without blood beforehand) to do this. That way, when the plane crashes the corpse would be heavily disfigured and have Dr. Pavel's blood. This worked as in a later scene in the movie, Miranda told Bruce that the \"Russian scientist died on a plane crash six months ago\".\" Bane also let one of his men stay behind, since \"[The CIA] expects one of us in the wreckage.\" That way, when the plane crashes, the CIA would assume something went awry with the men that the CIA brought the plane, giving Bane the chance to attack the plane from the outside which killed all the CIA agents, one Bane's men, and Dr. Pavel. The CIA would not know Bane was on the plane, since he killed the CIA agents after revealing himself."], ["How did Selina Kyle acquire all her gear?", "Selina is a professional cat burglar; it's likely that she buys the equipment she needs using the proceeds acquired from robbing the rich. It's also possible that she designed and constructed some of the items herself, or that she could have struck up business relations or friendships with the types of people who would sell or design the type of equipment she uses."], ["When Bruce is in his Batsuit, why does he talk in his \"Batman Voice\" when talking to himself or people who know his identity?", "When Bruce Wayne is in the Batsuit, he takes on the persona of Batman, so the gravelly, intimidating voice he uses can best be described as part of the outfit. Always keeping his voice altered while in the suit makes it harder for him to slip up and talk in his normal voice to the wrong person.\nHe may also have equiped his Batsuit with a voice modifier microphone/speaker in order to digitally alter his voice so he cannot speak with his real one when in his suit."], ["Why didn't Batman even attempt to blow up Bane with the Bat on the rooftop scene with Selina Kyle?", "For the same reason he didn't let the Joker keep falling after he threw him off the building in the previous film; Bruce said in the 1st film to Ra's about whether to execute a farmer who stole - \"I'm no executioner\". That is what Joker in the 2nd film calls Batman's \"one rule\". People might accidentally die because of his actions (such as fake Ra's Al Ghul in the 1st film, Harvey Dent in the 2nd film, or the driver of the bomb truck in 3rd film]), but he will never purposefully take their life. Batman's adherence to this rule is shown in the rooftop scene when he knocks a gun out of Catwoman's hands and says \"No guns, no killing\". It would've been hypocritical for him to later shoot down Bane and his men with the Bat. In Frank Miller's graphic novel, The Dark Knight Returns, there's a similar theme when Batman confronts the leader of a notorious and vicious gang called The Mutants. Batman has a moment where he can simply fire a powerful cannon on the latest version of the Batmobile (which resembles a tank) and destroy his enemy with one shot. He chooses to fight the Mutant Leader hand-to-hand because of personal principles he'd adopted years before that prevent him from being an executioner."], ["How come the illegitimate transaction wasn't overturned?", "The transaction would have been over turned, since Fox told Bruce the following day \"[in the] Long term we may be able to prove fraud, but for now...you're completely broke.\" But, Bane took Bruce out of Gotham before then. With a missing Bruce and a city held hostage, there would be no point in reversing the transaction. Plus, according to Lucius in his Manor visit, the program Bane and his men had assigned to Bruce put options and the options expired last night, making the newspaper say \"Wayne Doubles Down and Loses\". Because put option investments are in nature many months in retrospect, the program would only work by creating a false paper trail that lead back months. So even if any and all transactions on the day Bane attacked the exchange were voided, nobody would be the wiser to the fact that the fraudulent reports actually went back much longer than the day in question, thus creating a mess that must be investigated before fixing. Besides, Bane didn't need the plan to work long-term--only a couple of days to ensure that Miranda Tate was given control of Wayne Enterprises.\n\nAdditionally, even if a terrorist bankrupting a person by stock exchange may not realistically get away with it, the other Nolan Batman films have similar controversial events; so this is all part of the trilogy's overall comic-book-logic, whether people like it or not. For example, in the The Dark Knight, realistically, Batman can't get away with kidnapping Lau and allowing the Gotham legal system to prosecute him, since it would cause diplomatic tensions between Gotham's government, the U.S. Federal Government, and China. Lau said, \"the Chinese would not extradite one of their own\"; China also definitely would not let any foreign entity, like Gotham, use and imprison Lau and get away with it, just like the U.S. wont let a Chinese guy dressed as a bat get away with kidnapping a U.S. citizen on U.S. soil and letting China try him. China would call Batman being a \"vigilante\" a bluff, since he gave Lau to Gotham's Police Force; China would then demand the U.S. to return Lau to China so China could try him. Otherwise, China would not show signs of weakness to America and consider the kidnapping an act of war and the U.S. Federal Government would force Gotham to return Lau to prevent Chinese retaliation--not allowing the events of The Dark Knight to go through. (The film is missing the script line where a reporter asks about China's anger. Plus, Lau was still in a Gotham jail by the time Joker was first caught so the film ignored the realistic situation.)"], ["How did Bruce heal his back in five months? Is his leg healed too?", "Bruce Wayne's back was dislocated, not broken, in the first fight with Bane. This is confirmed when the prisoner said to Bruce \"You have a protruding vertebra...I'm going to force it back...\" Aligning vertebrae heals fast, since no bones were broken. Only spinal ligament muscles were torn--although ligaments take over a year to fully heal, a few months of healing is enough to stabilize the back. And even if his vertebrae was broken, vertebrae takes to 3 months to heal so, the time frame is regardlessly fine. Bruce's leg may or may not have the brace still on since we never see him without the trousers in the Pit. We are to assume Bane left it on, since he thought Bruce couldn't escape. Nevertheless, if Bruce didn't have it, then he walked with the pain. No cartilage in the knee means he has osteoarthritis in the knee and that causes painful, stiff joints--not inability to walk); Bruce in the beginning of the film was still able to jump out of the hospital room in one scene and dance with Selina in another before the scene when he got the knee brace. Things like canes and knee braces help put weight off the knee to making walking less painful."], ["In the first fight, why didn't Batman focus his punches on Bane's face or use the sleep darts shown later in the film?", "A few times in the fight Batman did try to focus his punches to Bane's mask, in which Bane tauntingly accepts. But, each time he did that, Bane would grab his fist after a hit or two to prevent him from punching it more. (Bane did the same thing in the 2nd fight until Batman managed to overcome it.) So, Batman would just hit everything else since Bane would let him. If Batman used the darts, Bane would have saw and dodged them considering Bane was trained in the same ninja arts as Batman. Plus, when Batman turned the lights off, Bane too would have probably saw and dodged them since he was accustomed to darkness for light is \"blinding\" to him."], ["How was Bane able to withstand Batman's attacks without showing any signs of pain?", "It is stated by Bruce's caretake that Bane's mask \"holds the pain at bay\" (most likely with morphine, as the prison doctor is stated to have been a morphine addict). This presumably resulted in Bane being at least partially, perhaps even fully, insensitive to Batman's attacks, for analgesics taken orally affect the central nervous systems and nerves around the body connected to it. Alternatively, as Bane says to Batman when they first face off, \"Peace has cost you your strength. Victory has defeated you,\" meaning that Batman's 8-year absence from training and fighting left him in a weakened state, so his hits had little to no effect on a seasoned combatant like Bane."], ["How did Bane know where Batman's armory and fusion core were located?", "In the film, Fox mentions that Applied Sciences was always officially shut down and mentioned that \"after your father died, Wayne Enterprises set up 14 different defense subsidiaries. I spent years putting the prototypes under one roof my roof - to prevent it from getting in the wrong hands\". The only reason why he would have done that is if Applied Sciences is still on the books before he was CEO. And it is the case, since in Batman Begins, Bruce, when asked by CEO Earl about which division in Wayne Enterprise he wants to work for, responded \"Applied Sciences caught my eye\". So, Applied Sciences was on the books before Fox was CEO, even if it was shut down in Batman Begins for the lights were off and Fox called the division a \"dead-end\" when Bruce first visited it. Since Ra's Al Ghul mentioned to Bruce in Batman Begins, \"you are defending a city so corrupt that we have infiltrated every level of its infrastructure\", the League would be aware of Applied Sciences when it infiltrated Wayne Enterprises in this first film\". And Fox put it off the books in The Dark Knight since the accountant Mr. Reese finds out that Applied Science's numbers didn't add up and the division disappeared overnight. And in _The Dark Knight Rises_ (qv), since Miranda in her 8 years as a board member would notice that the division isn't on the books anymore, she would assume that Bruce hid his armory from there and the League would tell Bane about its original location when learning from the original League members. With regard to the fusion core, Bane was affiliated with Talia al Ghul, who had previously visited the chamber, so she would have told him its location."], ["Was Bane actually born in the prison?", "In the comics, Bane was in fact born in a prison and spent the first part of his life there, forced to serve out his father's prison sentence by a cruel dictator who had decided to punish the family. In the movie, Alfred says rumors say \"there is a prison in a more ancient part of the world. A pit. But sometimes a man rises from the darkness\" and that Bane was \"born and raised in hell on earth. No one knows why or how he escaped\". Later, Bane gives a speech to Batman about being born in darkness and not seeing the light until he was a man. Then, in the pit, he tells Bruce when the latter asks \"where am I\" that they are \"home.\" Finally, a long time ago in the pit, Bruce's caretaker said Bane protected the child Talia since he wanted to \"show the others that [the child's] innocence was their redemption\". That logic only works if Bane himself was born in the pit and felt sympathy for another innocent person being born there. All in all, we can deduce Bane really was born in the pit."], ["How does Bane seem to be one step ahead of everyone?", "Talia al Ghul manages to keep herself plugged in to a lot of the resistance movements in the city after Bane takes control, so she'd be able to tip Bane when there were people ready to make a move. For example, when the Special Forces team manages to infiltrate the city, Blake takes them to where Lucius, Miranda and others are hiding. Bane shows up and kills the Special Forces team, having heard the news from Talia."], ["How did Bane transport Bruce to the pit prison so quickly, and how did Bruce get back to Gotham?", "Alfred mentions to Bruce early in the film that the pit is in \"some more ancient part of the world.\" (The filmed fort is in Jodhpur, India), but the film's \"deshi basara\" chant is in Moroccan Arabic, so we can assume the pit is in Morocco. Thus, the pit is only an ocean away from the U.S. Bane also has a cargo plane since he used it to attack the CIA plane in the beginning of the film; Miranda/Talia also has a plane, when she says to Bruce: \"We could leave. Tonight. Take my plane. Go anywhere we wanted\"; Bane would have used either to transport Bruce.\n\nConcerning how much time Bruce had to get back to the U.S. from the pit, Lucius tells the Special Forces that \"[the bomb] will go off. In twenty-three days.\" A couple scenes later, Bruce escapes the Pit. When Bruce gets back to Gotham, he tells Selina \"the bomb goes off tomorrow.\" Thus, we can assume Bruce had 3 weeks to get back to Gotham, which is plenty of time. The film does not visually show how Bruce got back to Gotham, because it is already established Bruce already had these skills from Batman Begins. _The Dark Knight Rises_ (qv) has two mis-en-scene allusions to this previous film to remind the audience of this: Bruce wearing rough clothing with a makeshift travel bag on the tough terrain after leaving the pit alludes to Bruce traveling the Tibetan mountains in Batman Begins. Selina sharing an apple with the orphan before Bruce returns alludes the Batman Begin's scene when Bruce shared an apple with a boy in sub-Saharan Africa. In Batman Begins, Bruce traveled the world for 7 years in poverty and no other resources --sneaking and stealing his way by-- to understand the minds of criminals. Then, when he was trained by the League of Shadows, he mastered the use of theatricality, \"invisibility\", and other ninja skills. It is obvious Bruce could have just got back to the U.S. by sneaking in a plane or boat, faking a passport, etc. (Also, although Bruce got back to the U.S. through a private jet in Batman Begins, the same film shows him burning his wallet, giving his coat to a hobo, and then sneaking into a boat by the Gotham port to leave the U.S. So, he has the ability to do transatlantic travel all by himself.)\n\nIn terms of getting into Gotham, Gotham wasn't technically quarantined, as food shipments were allowed in. Citizens just weren't allowed out. The film itself establishes direct explanation for getting onto the island--the Special Forces being undercover as men delivering supplies. It proves that other people were also successfully sneaking into the city during Occupied Gotham. Nevertheless, there are three ways suggested in the film. (1) Bruce sneaked in the same way as the Special Forces did through the shipments. (2) he walked on ice to Gotham with 'sure-footing' as shown in his training with Ra's al Ghul in the first film, Batman Begins . This is actually confirmed in _The Dark Knight Rises_ (qv) when Batman meets Gordon halfway along the ice, walking effortlessly towards him. (3) He used the Bat to get on the islands since it was last parked in the Bat-cave when Bruce left Gotham and then seen draped over on a roof top in the island when he returned. Wayne Manor is outside the Gotham's islands (and on the U.S. mainland). In The Dark Knight Harvey wondered if the manor is in city limits and Bruce said it is in the Palisades, which is considered withing the city by jurisdiction. Harvey asked this probably since the Palisades is not in the islands of Gotham. In the Gotham map that appeared in the film's viral marketing online game The Fire Rises (not to be confused with the the strike-zone Gotham map in another viral marketing site), the manor and Palisades is outside the islands and on the mainland. This fact is important since we saw in the film Bane blow up the bridges connecting the islands with the mainland. In the end of the film, nothing suggests that Wayne Manor was looted or attacked by Bane's men or criminals."], ["Is Ra's al Ghul truly immortal as he appears to Bruce in the Pit?", "In the dream scene, Ra's disappears after talking with Bruce inside a cell. The scene carries a striking resemblance to the first meeting of Bruce & Ra's in the Chinese prison in Batman Begins. Keep in mind a few things: Bruce had just undergone serious physical trauma (getting his dislocated back reset without painkillers). Bruce had been strung up to straighten out his back; while the scene transition is instant, he had clearly been in that position for weeks. When Bruce's vertebra is put back into place, he had minor stubble on his face; when he looks up to see the apparition of Ra's al Ghul, he has long facial hair, almost the same as what he had at the beginning of the film. Bruce already had all the information that Ra's discusses with him. Learning about the fabled mercenary and knowing Ra's in person simply meant putting two and two together. By this time, Bruce had thought of the young child as the young Bane. In his dream, Ra's supports Bruce as he thinks Bane is the heir of Ra's al Ghul. If it was Ra's in reality, then he'd correct Bruce about his child. In the end, both Talia and Bane effectively confirm that Ra's was killed by Batman in the first film. It's pretty safe to assume that the Ra's in this film was just a hallucination, nothing more. Alternate meaning: Ra's mentions how immortality comes in many forms. Being alive in Bruce's mind provides him a form of immortality, and syncing up with Batman Begins has made him a sort of legend, even if it is only in Bruce's mind. Additionally, Ra's al Ghul can be seen as immortal through his legacy. In the comics Ra's al Ghul is literally immortal via use of the Lazarus Pit. He is also obsessed with his legacy...finding a suitable successor to his position of 'Demon's Head' (the literal meaning of 'Ra's al Ghul'...the head or leader of the League of Shadows). So to translate that to film, Nolan made Ra's al Ghul immortal through his legacy...through his heir (whether that be Bane or Talia). Bane's (and eventually Bruce Wayne's) prison in the film (a pit) acts as a literal interpretation of the Lazarus Pit from the source material...Ra's al Ghul's legacy rises from the pit to take over his task...making the position of Ra's al Ghul and his mission immortal."], ["Why did Bane wait 5 months to blow up Gotham?", "We know the bomb will explode in five months without doing anything with it, since Bane mentioned to Dr. Pavel in the reactor chamber: \"Five, by my calculations\". So he takes advantage of this time period to first torture Gotham as it in turn tortures Bruce. In the pit scene, Bane tells Bruce that he wants to torture \"not of your body, but of your soul\", instead of killing him since \"[he] doesn't fear death but welcomes it\". He explains how he learned there is \"no true despair without hope\" because the Pit made the prisoners like \"shipwrecked men turning to sea water from uncontrollable thirst\"; so trying to save themselves will instead kill them. Bane pointed to a TV and said \"[y]ou will watch as I torture an entire city\" by feeding them a false sense of \"hope to poison their souls\" under the anarchy. That way, Gotham would reveal its evil nature to the world by \"clamoring each other to stay in the sun\". He said Bruce would then \"under[stand] the depth of [his] failure\"--that his work as Batman was fruitless. Gotham is inherently evil and nonredeemable for the eight year of peace proved nothing about Gotham's good, with Gotham's citizens still being greedy and destructive when given the chance by Bane. So justifying the Ra's hallucination Bruce later had: \"the only victory [Bruce] could achieve was a lie. . .Gotham is beyond saving\". This Gotham will rot under anarchy theme was predicted by Joker in the previous movie: \"[Gothamites'] morals, their code... it's a bad joke. Dropped at the first sign of trouble. They're only as good as the world allows them to be. You'll see- I'll show you... when the chips are down, these civilized people... they'll eat each other.\""], ["Why did the protector protect the child in the pit? Why did the prisoners help Bruce?", "The protector protected the child from the prisoners in the pit, because according to the caretaker prisoner, the protector wanted to \"[show] the others that this [child's] innocence was their redemption.\" We later found out Bane was the protector--so since he too was born in the pit and lived there as a child, he felt sympathy towards the child. The prisoners helped Bruce, because the prisoners weren't bad people. Long gone are the days the warlord owned the pit. The caretaker prisoner said \"This is Bane's prison now. Bane would not want this story told.\" Thus, Bane owns this prison and uses it to lock up his enemies. Even if the audience missed this fact, they could assume that the prisoners would help each other out since once one man escapes, he can put the 2nd rope --the supply rope-- down into the pit so all can escape. And when Bruce escaped, he put that rope down back into the pit."], ["How did Bruce survive the rope falls in the Pit? What about he surviving the knife stab in the judicial hall?", "The force of falling with the rope probably was enough to injure him significantly. The reason being is questionable falls like this is in the overall Dark Knight Trilogy logic, whether people like it or not. For example, The Dark Knight, Joker and his 2 men somehow survived the 18 wheeler flip despite the ridiculous amount of g-force from 40 tons of truck weight and it going at full speed. Likewise, Batman and Rachel somehow survived the multistory penthouse fall even though they crushed the car roof and we see it cave in (So the cape barely breaked) and Batman landed on his back. For the knife stab, the stab wound was probably not fatal--rather to incapacitate Batman long enough so the bomb would go off. Batman was stabbed between the rib by the liver area, in which stab wounds, including liver wounds, are known to be non-fatal if no major artery is hit. That waist/liver area's only major artery is the hepatic artery and that is far deep in the center of the body and not that reachable by knife. Considering Talia told Bane not to shoot him after she stabbed him, because she wanted Batman to live and \"Feel the fire of twelve million souls [he] failed\", we can assume it isn't fatal. Nevertheless, in The Dark Knight, along with a crow bar in his left hand, we see a knife in Joker's right hand and he stabbed Batman multiple times in their final fight and Batman survived. Thus, we can assume that Talia's stabbing isn't a big deal."], ["What are the prisoners chanting in the Pit?", "The prisoners chant deshi basara, Moroccan Arabic for \"He rises.\" It's also used in Hans Zimmer's score for the film."], ["What happened to the Mayor?", "He is killed during Bane's attack on the football field. After the field starts imploding, there's a brief shot of a second bomb going off inside his viewing box."], ["When Bane removed the core, why didn't Lucius flood the chambers?", "The flood does not decommission the bomb: Lucius and Bruce said that \"The bomb goes off in 12 hours unless we reconnect it to the reactor.\" So, only the reactor can decommission the bomb. The flood is to be used to destroy the reactor when the core is decommissioned and so nothing can turn the core on. For why Lucius didn't flood the chamber before the core was removed, Miranda told Batman she knows how to override reactor and how to override the flood: \"Fox told me how to override the reactor--including the emergency flood.\" We can deduce she learned this from Lucius before Bane got to the reactor since there is nothing to override if the core is already out of the reactor. So if Lucius would to somehow activate the flood, she would override the flood. And we know she had a trigger for controlling the flood mechanism since she remotely flooded it at the end of the film. Assuming Lucius had a trigger too, he still couldn't flood it. All of Bane's men in the chamber were armed and three of these men and Bane were surrounding and watching Miranda, Lucius, and Pavel in that scene. So, he couldn't risk doing any suspicious movements for flooding the chamber. And up at the reactor controls, Bane was standing directly next to the controls and watching him put his hands on the screen so he couldn't do anything at the controls or Bane would stop him. Finally, from what Miranda said to Lucius: \"You kill this man and yourself and barely slow them down\", it signals to Lucius not only that Bane would get other board members to turn the reactor on, but also why she won't flood the chamber; he will also assume it'll be counterproductive, because Bane's men, being able-bodied, will not be slowed down and escape though the chamber's blast hole and still cause destruction with their men and tumblers, and he and the other board members will die pointlessly."], ["Why did Commissioner Gordon send every available cop into the sewer?", "The reason why he sent \"every available cop\" was he already had Foley send teams down into the sewer but couldn't find Bane and his men. In the hospital scene with Gordon, Foley, and Blake, Gordon asked about the tunnel searches and Foley said \"We've had teams down there, but it's a huge network.\" Blake then gave Foley all the tunnel maps and then Gordon said \"Get more men, work a grid. I want [Bane] found\" so they sent even more teams down there. But since they still couldn't find him and Foley informed Gordon that Bane kidnapped the Wayne Enterprise board and brought them into the sewer, Gordon said then said \"no more patrols, no more hide and seek\"; so the cops had already patrolled the sewers multiple times but couldn't find Bane's men since they were cat-and-mousing the cops. Since Gordon wanted to increase the chances of finding and cornering them, he said \" send every available cop\" to \"smoke them out\". Nevertheless, not every cop was sent. There still is a significant back bone of the force remaining on the street, making up the resistance. This is shown in the scene behind the meat store where the Special Forces asks Gordon, Foley and Blake how many cops are left. Gordon says there are \"dozens of us but [he] preferred not to say.\" And we can see many of these surviving cops standing behind Gordon in the scene and later helping him out in the film. Unfortunately, these cops were heavily out numbered by Bane's men. The audience must remember that Gordon only sent \"every available cop\", not necessarily every cop, in order to smoke out Bane's army. Plus Foley called back much of his men from the tunnel when Blake informed him that the cops were heading into the trap. Finally, the cops left on the surface are shown to be older than the ones sent running to the sewer. This means that the veteran cops were left behind to continue policing on the surface, since they aren't as able bodied to fight the army unlike the younger cops. An example is the older cop that chased Batman in the beginning of the film and told the younger cop \"you are in for a show tonight son.\" He is later seen standing next to Gordon in the meat shop and later scenes."], ["How is it possible that the cops do not show any sign of beard growth after being buried in the tunnels for all that time?", "Bane told Bruce Wayne in the Pit that he wanted to feed the people of Gotham \"hope to poison their souls\". Bane said in his speech outside of Black Gate that the police would survive and at the same time a scene in the film is shown of the underground cops getting provisions drawn down to them by rope, which were sent via the bridge and then distributed to them. We see hygiene equipment like sheets, jugs, and pots in the scene -so we can assume other hygiene equipment like razors in order to keep illness from spreading was provided too."], ["Was Gotham in a Recession? And why did Gothamites participate in Bane's revolution if he is a terrorist?", "Yes it was. The recession was probably caused by Wayne Enterprise and started 3 years before the film. That is because the company is in a slump; according to a conversation between Bruce and Lucius, Bruce \"lost most of [the company's] money\" in the fusion reactor investment and not using it to regain profits. As Lucius said, \"[Bruce funneled] the entire R and D budget for five years into a fusion project that [he] then mothball[ed], [his] company is unlikely to thrive\". Since the orphanage's Father Reilly said the orphanage was \"[n]ot for a couple years now\" funded by the Wayne Foundation, in which according to Alfred is funded by the profits of Wayne Enterprises, that means Wayne Enterprise is very low on profits with only the Dent Day event still being funded. For Wayne Enterprises, all this loss of financial capital causes less output, a lot of layoffs in the company, stock holders lose money, investments in and out of the company decrease, public works and non-profits like orphanages it used to fund stop, and any economic work - the kind Ra's mentioned that Thomas Wayne's W.E.did that saved Gotham in Batman Begins - is undone. Since Wayne Enterprise is the predominant economic force, conglomerate and thus employer in Gotham, this causes a domino effect similar to the real life 2008 housing industry bubble in which a flailing major industry affects all other industries. So, since Wayne Enterprise and former employees can't do as much business with the other Gotham industries, there is even less output and layoffs there too, leading to decreased economic activity in Gotham. That is why when the outgrown orphan boys went to find jobs, an orphan said there was \"[m]ore [work in the sewer] than you can find up here [on the surface].\"\n\nThe layoffs/lack of jobs/lower pay in the recession caused a wealth gap between the rich and the poor/middle class, since the latter suffer the most in the recession from having less savings and capital to recover with than the rich. This causes class tension between them, and a distrust of capitalism among the non-rich if small businesses fail and industries wont hire them. Selina mocked Bruce that the poor are soon going to be able to get revenge on the rich: \"There's a storm coming. . .[for] you and your friends. . .when it hits you're all gonna wonder how you ever thought you could live so large and leave so little for the rest of us\". Also, a reporter mocked Bruce when he lost all of his money by saying \"how does it feel to be one of the people?\" The gap and tension helped justify Gothamites to participate in Bane's wealth distribution revolution. Once Bane took over and threatened to blow up the city if citizens didn't oblige to his revolution, Gothamites have nothing more to lose but to do what Bane said in the football stadium: \"claim what is rightfully [theirs]\" as Bane later in front of Blackgate that Gothamites were oppressed by the rich and \"myth of opportunity\". Plus, Gothamites didn't know the decaying fuel cells would cause the bomb to go off in 5 months since Bane only mentioned it in the reactor chamber, not the public. Thus, assuring the people to trust Bane's revolution further. (Only Bruce's allies would know, since Lucius and Miranda helped build the reactor and know its properties and would share the info with Gordon and Blake. And Bruce would already know this, since he helped build the reactor.)"], ["Why did Bane reveal the truth of Harvey Dent and would Gothamites believe the speech is fake since he is a terrorist?", "Bane's speech was to: 1) Justify the 1000 prisoners into loyalty to him in the revolution \"so an army will be raised\" for him. Just freeing them without cause may not be enough since the 1000 criminals probably outnumber Bane's men and Bane doesn't want them attacking his men, hence why he wants the former to be part of his army. And we know the prisoners are then loyal to Bane since the prisoners run the kangaroo courts for Bane and not against the mercenaries. Plus, the unfairness being locked up for good by being denied parole because of a lie martyring a violent criminal justifies to prisoners to attack and prosecute any remaining cops and authorities in which what Bane wants.\n2) Crush the souls of the remaining surface police to weaken their moral and make them vulnerable to capture and torture Bruce in the pit.\n3) Torture Gothamites with hope that Bane is lying about the truth of Harvey. Bane's plan for Gotham was to \"feed its people hope to poison their souls.\" Telling them the truth with concrete evidence supporting the speech's authenticity doesn't feed Gothamites hope. The ambiguity of the speech's authenticity would torture and confuse Gothamites for months since they would be conflicted whether or not the system lied to them for 8 years and martyred an evil man for peace. And this ambiguity would worsen since Gothamites would already know from Dent Day's attendees and press that Gordon looked uncomfortably and said \"the time isn't right\" and put away his speech. So there was already suspicion about the truth of Dent. And since Gothamites would already know Gordon was attacked in the sewer and ended up in the hospital and would figure that Bane originally came from the sewer since he rigged it up to trap the police, the public would uncomfortably theorize that Bane got the speech from him in the sewer."], ["Why did Bane not tell Gotham that he had defeated Batman? Wouldn't it be more frightening for the people to know that there is no one there to save them?", "Bane's plan was \"to feed [Gotham's] people hope to poison their souls\". There is no reason for him to say he beat and imprisoned Batman if he wanted people to have hope that he is still out there. Nevertheless, if he would have told them that Batman was defeated from the first place, it would be possible that people, knowing that they have nothing to lose, could rise against him and the League of Shadows."], ["Why didn't Bane tell Gotham Batman's true identity?", "He had no reason to.

It's a very long way across, and crawling would cause the body parts exposed to the ice (even through clothes) to become extremely frostbitten and result in hypothermia and death. Stryver is also wearing only the suit he had on during his \"trial,\" which offers him very little protection from the freezing temperatures. Walking is his best bet. Furthermore, the ex-cons and Bane's men were probably under orders to shoot anyone not walking on two feet. The point isn't to let exiles cross the ice safely; it's to give them the \"hope\" that they will survive (similar to what Bane talks about earlier) before the inevitable fall and death."], ["How did Bruce find Selina when he returned to Gotham?", "Selina mentioned in that scene \"You boys know you can't come into my neighborhood without asking politely.\" Thus, that scene's setting was her neighborhood. And Bruce had visited her neighborhood before in a previous scene in the film when John Blake drove him to her house. So he just checked each street in her neighborhood until he found her. Nevertheless, whether the audience missed out on this fact or not, Bruce Wayne is known to locate people easily. For example, in The Dark Knight, Batman located Maroni in a club and then located Harvey Dent who was secretly interrogating in a dark alley in the following scene."], ["Why does Batman waste time constructing the Fiery Batsignal on the bridge?", "Batman has always been more than just a man, an icon of fear among Gotham underworld, a beacon of hope. The mere presence of his sign provided the hope to all Gothamites that their valiant knight has returned to their side. This is the very reason that inspires the massive number of cops waiting the next morning (Foley being an example of many unknown): The symbol of Batman gave them the spirit to stand up against a superior force. Bruce either made it right before he talked to Selina when he got back, or made it years before in case of a threat like that of Bane ever arose and that Batman only needed to position it & ignite it. This controversy in when Batman made the signal can be similarly compared to how in The Dark Knight, did Joker have time to rig the biggest hospital in Gotham and two ferries with bombs. Just like we can assume Joker did it earlier off-screen, we can assume Batman did his earlier off-screen too."], ["Were the cops carrying any weapons in the all out assault on Bane's men?", "Yes.

Isn't Bane supposed to be physically superior?", "Several factors come into play: (1) He fights more strategically in their second battle by going for what he now knows is Bane's weak spot, the mask, taking blows in order to expose Bane's vulnerability. Batman eventually damaged the mask with the blades on his gauntlets, which leaves Bane severely weakened and distracted as he needs an anesthetic pumped into his lungs continually to dull the pain from injuries he suffered in prison. (2) Batman's mental training and fear of Bane may have also driven his survival anger to a higher level, as is common for trained combatants in life-threatening situations. (3) Bruce worked out extensively in prison to get himself as close to the physical prime he had 8 years earlier. (Bruce is noticeably exhausted rather quickly in his first fight with Bane) (4) When Batman first faced off with Bane, he had seriously underestimated Bane as a threat.

But due to this being the end of the trilogy, one can more or less confirm that he died from the forces brought on."], ["Why did the League want to destroy Gotham if it isn't corrupt?", "The primary reason why the League wants to destroy Gotham was because Talia wanted to avenge her father's murder by finishing his work of destroying Gotham: \"I honor my father by finishing his work. Vengeance against the man who killed him is simply a reward for my patience\". After Ra's excommunicated Bane, Talia said she couldn't \"truly forgive [her] father - until [Bruce] murdered him\". That is when Talia finally cherished her father's importance in her life. Ra's in Batman Begins' campfire scene taught Bruce about how \"Vengeance\" against the ones who hurt his \"loved one\" saved him and asks Bruce \"why you don't avenge your parent's murder?\" Avenging loved ones is something he would have taught Talia and he did for Talia had used the League to what she called \"exact terrible vengeance\" on the prisoners of the pit since they killed her mother and hurt her protector Bane. So when Ra's died, Talia would honor him for what he did in her life - he had helped her avenge her mother's murder and what the prisoners did to Bane - and because \"he took us [,Bane and I,] in. Trained us\". Ra's rescuing Bane and training him so he didn't have to live his whole life in pain forever in prison overrides her father excommunicating him from the League, since Ra's had done more good for Bane than bad. Nevertheless, when Talia infiltrated Wayne Enterprises 8 years ago, she didn't destroy Gotham for she would have learned Bruce rid Gotham from criminal control. So she wanted to financially fix Gotham and save the world by what she called \"free clean energy for entire city\" and the \"world's best chance for a sustainable future\" - the fusion reactor. But since Bruce enraged her by mothballing it 5 years in and ruined her project from seeing the daylight because of the reactor-to-bomb paper, she never forgot what Bruce did to her father because of \"the knife that waits years without forgetting\" and finally wanted to destroy Gotham by using the core as a bomb to rub it in his face. And when Miranda gave Bruce another chance by taking control of the reactor, Bruce still wouldn't let her use it since when she asked what can she do with it, he said \"Nothing, until we can find a way to guarantee its safety.\" Bruce also said they will \"Decommission it [and] [f]lood it.\", if she doesn't do it. Nevertheless, after Bane found Gordon's letter, the League then regained its original reason to destroy Gotham for Bruce's work was built on a lie that allowed the whole mob to be locked up for good despite Dent being a murderer; Dent's prosecution of locking the whole mob up should have been undone in appeal and the Dent Act had no right to deny parole. Thus, Bruce and all law enforcement are just as corrupt and unjust as the criminals. So, Gotham is even more corrupt than 8 years ago for now both the good and bad guys are corrupt. Thus, whether the reactor would be used for its original purpose of saving Gotham didn't matter anymore - in the words of decoy Ra's Al Ghul explaining the League's goal in the 1st film: \"[i]Gotham's time has come. Like Constantinople or Rome before it the city has become a breeding ground for suffering and injustice. It is beyond saving and must be allowed to die. This is the most important function of the League of Shadows. It is one we've performed for centuries. Gotham... must be destroyed\"\n\n"], ["Why does Bane want to destroy Gotham if Ra's Al Ghul excommunicated him?", "The film addresses this twice: Bane is shown to hate his excommunication but the film gives us his two motivations for destroying Gotham right after his excommunication is mentioned.\n1) Bane was angry when Bruce mentioned it. That is because he considers himself part of the League -\"and you betrayed us\" - and considers the League as his family - \"No, they expect one of us in the wreckage, brother\" (And no, the two guys in the sewer he killed are not League members, but thugs he hired in the depression since unlike the mercenaries in that scene, the thugs don't have mercenary clothing, were not confident or loyal, questioned Bane, and lacked League demeanor). Because he loves the League, Bane snarled at Bruce for he hates that Bruce betrayed the League. So when Bruce mentioned to Bane that \"you were excommunicated by a gang of psychopaths\", Bane went berserk and then confidently boasted \"I am the League of Shadows and I am here to fulfill Ra's Al Ghuls destiny!\" So by calling himself the League, he is showing how devoted he is to the League and will fulfill Ra's destiny to prove to his ego he shouldn't have been excommunicated. And since he hates Bruce Wayne for betraying the League and more or less replacing him, Bane wants to prove his superiority of over Bruce. And he proves this by physically and tactically out maneuvering Bruce, saying, \"The shadows betray you because they belong to me\". He is so confident that he is superior to Bruce that he thought Bruce couldn't escape the pit: \"I broke you how did you come back?\" (If Bane is superior to Bruce and Bane never escaped the pit by himself, therefore, Bruce also can't escape the pit.) And because of his sense of superiority towards Bruce, he secretly disobeyed Talia by almost killing Bruce. So, that means his hatred of Bruce Wayne rivals his love for Talia - his primary motivation. 2) Bane started shedding tears when Talia mentioned Ra's excommunicated Bane from the League of Shadows. That is because he loved Talia - \"His only crime is that he loved me\". According to the prison caretaker, Bane loved her to prove to the other prisoners her \"innocence was their redemption\". So, Bane wanted to redeem himself by helping a fellow innocent child born in the pit like him. And when he saved her, he was rewarded when Talia had Ra's Al Ghul exact terrible vengeance on the prisoners that hurt Bane and her mother and had Ra's rescue him, take him into the League, and train him. And when her father kicked him out, she didn't forgive him and ran away with Bane and we know she did this since Ra's never told Bruce about Talia because of their estranged relationship. So all this shows Talia loves Bane back. When Talia inherited the League and will now destroy Gotham for her father, she undid the excommunication, allowing him to be part of League, in which he will be happy to rejoin the organization he loved and fulfill Ra's Al Ghuls destiny to prove he shouldn't be excommunicated. So, Bane will destroy Gotham also for Talia because of what she did for him."], ["Is Bane, Talia's \"lackey\"?", "Yes he is and that isn't a bad thing. The characterizing of being a lackey comes from destroying Gotham at its root being Talia's idea and Bane's primary motivation for doing it is out of his love for Talia. (This characterization comes from The Tale of Two Cities, in which the film draws much influence from, since Talia is based of Madame Dufarge and Bane is based of Monsieur Dufarge. In that novel, it appeared to be that it was Monsieur Dufarge's idea to cause the revolution for he is shown finding the letter, leading the storming of Bastille, using his store as a planning hub for the revolutionaries, etc. But, it is later revealed near the end that it was Madame Dufarge's idea for she wanted to avenge her family's murder and her husband Monsieur Dufarge did it out of his love for her. Nevertheless, Mr. Dufarge still believed in the revolution bringing justice to France so he had this other motivation to do it. Likewise, Bane believes Gotham is corrupt from working with Daggett, observing the wealth gap, and discovering Gordon's letter) The film takes a risk to make the audience assume Bane is Talia's lackey. That is because it wants the audience to make the connection that Bane is Talia's Alfred. \"Lackey\" by definition means \"man-servant\". If Talia is an anti-Bruce, for both are orphans, businessmen, ninjas, and want to avenge their father's murder by destroying/saving Gotham, then she must have a man-servant too. And Bane is her anti-Alfred, for he is intelligent, older, skilled, and loves their surrogate child as an adoptive father (Bane appears about 20 years older than Talia in the present and the flashback scenes). And the parallels between protagonists and antagonists are based of the \"duality\" aspect drawn from Tale of Two Cities."], ["Why did the League wait 8 years to destroy Gotham and why use the fusion reactor bomb to destroy Gotham instead of easily getting some other nuclear bomb?", "They waited 8 years so--in Banes words--\"peace has cost [Bruce] his strength\" mentally and physically so he can't fight back and to see Gotham's state after Batman's impact. Considering Talia took on the Miranda alias and asked Bruce to help invest in the what Lucius called \"first of its kind\" fusion project, we can assume for 5 years she wanted to observe post-Batman Gotham. The energy project was for she said \"to invest to restore balance to the world\" by providing \"free clean energy to entire city\". And if Dr. Pavel's paper was never published, Gotham would be at peace from both Batman's work and the reactor's economic impact. But because of the weaponized fusion reactor paper 3 years prior to the film, Bruce claimed the reactor had problems and would not allow anyone to use it. Talia was then angry at Bruce for ruining what she called \"the world's best chance for a sustainable future\"; revenge for her father kicked in and she and Bane then planned for 3 years to use it as a way to keep the government at bay and put Gotham in a 5 month occupation and social experiment to reveal Gothamites' evil nature and torture Bruce. (She couldn't just steal the reactor to be used for its original purpose, since Wayne Enterprise would catch on to it, nor could she ask some other investor to help make another reactor since the reactor is very expensive--nearly bankrupting Wayne--and Bruce said the reactor had problems--no one would invest in something that could fail.) The League couldn't use any other bomb since unlike the reactor's fusion-based/neutron bomb, other nuclear bombs leave significant radioactive waste and that is against the League's \"restore balanced to the world\" philosophy. For getting a neutron bomb, handling a few CIA guys and kidnapping a scientist that can turn a reactor in Gotham into a bomb is somewhat easier than infiltrating heavily guarded military facilities to directly steal and somehow handle a neutron bomb and bring it to Gotham safely."], ["Were Bane and The League Of Shadows on a suicide mission?", "It's implied they were on a suicide mission from the very beginning. In the opening prologue, Bane tells one of his men to stay in the plane because the CIA expect to find one of them in the wreckage. The man complies unquestionably and seems almost proud that he could die for Bane's cause. Additionally, Stryver quotes Bane, saying his men would \"die before talking\" when Daggett asked about his captured men from the stock heist. All this showcases that all of Bane's men were fully and completely committed to Bane and the League's mission, perfectly ready and willing to sacrifice themselves to see it through. At the end of the film, when Talia reveals herself to Batman, she, without hesitation presses the trigger to detonate the bomb while her, Bane and all their men are still in the city limits. The bomb fails to detonate however they try to do whatever they can to see that it goes off. So since the League people seem to half no qualms about dying, it seems they had no intention of evacuating themselves before the bomb went off. They probably knew that if they wanted to completely take control of Gotham for any length of time, they wouldn't be able to get very far before the surrounding National Guard would captured or killed them, so the only option was to occupy the city until the very end.\n\nAn alternate possibility was that they had planned to evacuate shortly before the bomb went off. The bomb had a blast radius of six miles, which wouldn't take very long to get to a safe distance from. It's possible they could have cleared the tunnel or flown out and escaped . When the bomb went off, the military would likely be in a state of shock trying to figure out what happened and the League of Shadows could make their escape relatively unnoticed as the military would likely assume something went wrong and the bomb went off accidentally. This plan being foiled when Batman and 3000 police officers overran their base of operations. Another element that makes the possibility of them planning to escape likely is that Talia desired revenge against Bruce. Her speech about the slow knife she delivers after stabbing Batman supports this. It's possible they planned to evacuate before the bomb exploded so Talia could return to the pit, reveal her true identity, and kill him."], ["How come Bruce's caretaker and the doctor never corrected to Bruce that Bane was actually the protector?", "In the pit scene, his caretaker is telling Bruce the story of the one escapee of the pit. He mentions that one child born in the pit long ago escaped the pit. Considering the fact he knew Bane was born in the pit and escaped, Bruce assumed the child was Bane. So Bruce asked the caretaker \"Is Bane the child you spoke of? Was he born here?\" But, the caretaker ignored the question and still went on with the story. By the time the caretaker told Bruce that the child who escaped had a protector sympathetic towards him and a mother who then died, the prison doctor, upset that the caretaker mentioned his failure of forgetting to lock her cell, told him to be quiet. Thus, the caretaker never got the chance to fully tell Bruce the truth. By not telling him, this gave Bruce the courage to climb the pit. If Bane could climb the pit, he could too. If the caretaker told him the truth that it wasn't Bane but another child who escaped, Bruce wouldn't have the courage to climb. Plus, Bruce at that time didn't know the other child was Talia, since he neither heard of Talia, nor who she impersonated, until the end of the film. This is something the prisoners would not be familiar with too, because they aren't familiar that Talia is Miranda Tate. It's also very likely that the caretaker and the doctor feared what Bane might do to them if they revealed this to Bruce and Bane found out."], ["Shouldn't the signal blocker have been removed to once again try the trigger?", "The signal blocker was the EMP cannon-guidance mount that Bruce received from the Bat when he asked Lucius what could block the signal. EMP weaponry would completely fry a targeted electronic device if its strong enough or if the targeted device is complex in circuitry, for it is susceptible to overheating. Gordon put the blocker at point-blank range to the bomb. The device that connects the trigger and bomb is bound to be complex in circuitry because of the complexity of starting a nuclear reaction. So, these factors guarantee that the device connecting the trigger to the bomb would be completely fried by the EMP blocker and removing the blocker would be pointless."], ["Why does Bruce say \"Batman could be anybody\" to Blake when he didn't approve of the Batman impersonators in the previous movie?", "Bruce Wayne disapproved of the copycats because Bruce said, \"That isn't exactly what I meant when I said I wanted to inspire people,\" because he didn't want citizens to use vigilantism.\n\nIn Batman Begins, Bruce said, \"I'm gonna show the people of Gotham their city doesn't belong to the criminals and the corrupt.... People need dramatic examples to shake them out of apathy, and I can't do that as Bruce Wayne. As a man, I'm flesh and blood. I can be ignored. I can be destroyed. But as a symbol...I can be incorruptible. I can be everlasting...something elemental, something terrifying.\" Bruce became Batman to inspire people to fight against Gotham's corrupt and criminal. This works, according to the fake Batman that Joker interrogated, \"[by Batman being] a symbol; that we don't have to be afraid of scum like you\".. Bruce became a vigilante since the legal system was too corrupt to be used effectively against the evils. Bruce wanted to cleanse the legal system of the mobs' control.\n\nIn The Dark Knight, Bruce Wayne and Commissioner Gordon put all their faith in Harvey Dent, because he was the beacon of hope that Gotham City needed. Bruce wanted to inspire people that had a face that used legal means to fight criminals, not vigilantism. Bruce affirmed this by saying \"exactly\" after Natasha, Bruce's date, told Harvey, \"Gotham needs elected officials like you, not one who thinks he is above the law\".Batman then confirmed this to Dent: \"You are the symbol of hope I could never be. You are the first legitimate ray of light in Gotham in decades.\" The problem with having a public face, is the criminals know who to attack. Harvey lost Rachel and his own sanity because he was such a public figure for hope. After Harvey Dent became insane and goes on a killing spree, Batman told Gordon to pin Dent's crimes on him because \"I'm whatever Gotham needs me to be. Right now, it needs its true hero, [Harvey Dent].\"\n\nIn _The Dark Knight Rises_ (qv), Bruce tells Gordon in the hospital the \"Batman wasn't needed anymore we won\". But, Gordon tells him about an \"evil rising\" and tells Bruce that \"Batman has to come back\". So, Bruce learns that vigilantism is still needed even if the police have finally conquered organized crime because of greater threats like Bane. He told Alfred that he didn't give Bane's USB drive to the police since \"they don't have the tools to analyze it\" and he didn't trust them out of fear of Banes infiltration: \"one man's tool is another man's weapon.\" So, like in the past, in case the police needs help for more than they can handle, there must be a Batman -- and he later chooses Blake as his successor. Bruce Wayne tells Blake to wear a mask when fighting criminals in order to \"protect the people [he] care[s] about\". Bruce also states that he became Batman in order to \"be a symbol - Batman could be anybody, that was the point\". And this point explains the mechanics on exactly how people like the Batmen or Harvey were inspired and not afraid of scum in the first place. Since, Batman could be anyone, that means it is feasible for anyone to fix Gotham and not be afraid to do it for the person who was Batman wasn't afraid. And Dent, in The Dark Knight, apparently was inspired from Batman being anyone, for he said \"Gotham city is proud for an ordinary citizen standing up for what's right\" after Natasha had mocked the masked vigilante. So, Bruce never meant for people to impersonate him; rather, he wanted to inspire people to not be afraid and use legal means to fix Gotham."], ["How does the movie end?", "Bruce escapes from the prison and enlists Selina, Miranda, Blake, Gordon, and Fox to help stop the bomb's detonation. While the police and Bane's forces clash, Batman defeats Bane, but Miranda intervenes and stabs Batman, revealing herself to be Talia al Ghul, Ra's daughter, the child who escaped the prison aided by her fellow prisoner and protector, Bane. She plans to complete her father's work by detonating the bomb and destroying Gotham, but Gordon blocks her signal, preventing remote detonation. Talia goes after the bomb while Bane prepares to kill Batman, but Selina kills Bane using the Batpod. Batman pursues Talia with the Bat, hoping to bring the bomb back to the reactor where it can be stabilized. Talia's truck crashes, but she reveals to Batman, Gordon, and Selina that she has overridden the reactor as well as the emergency flood, leaving no way to stop the bomb from exploding. With no way to stop the detonation, Batman flies the bomb over the bay and drops it in the water, where it detonates. Batman is presumed dead and is honored as a hero. With Bruce also presumed dead, Wayne Manor is left to the city to become an orphanage, and Wayne's remaining estate is left to Alfred. Fox discovers that Bruce had fixed the Bat's autopilot, and Gordon finds the Bat-Signal refurbished. While visiting Florence, Alfred sees Bruce and Selina together. Blake, whose first name is revealed to be Robin, resigns from the police force and inherits the Batcave."], ["Wouldn't a nuclear bomb have caused significant nuclear fallout once detonated?", "The bomb was a \"weaponized fusion reactor\" according to Dr. Pavel's paper. Thus, it can be considered a fusion-based nuclear bomb. Normal nuclear bombs split radioactive elements into highly radioactive elements because they use fission. The fusion reactor only uses fusion. Fusion still has radiation i.e. heat, light, etc., but it has little to no radioactive waste - the only of sorts would be fast neutrons which would be absorbed by the water with no ill effects. Later, Dr. Pavel specified to the public in the stadium that the it was a neutron bomb. So \"weaponized fusion reactor\" really meant the conversion of the fusion core into a neutron bomb. Although it has more radiation than normal nuclear bombs, neutron bombs' radioactive waste would dissipate to safe levels quickly and the fallout would lose significance as distance increases from the original detonation point. This would also be in keeping with The League of Shadows' motives. Their intention is to destroy Gotham and its corrupt inhabitants in order to restore balance to the world - ruining the environment is not \"The movement back to harmony\" that Ra's mentioned in the first film. Since the bomb was detonated many miles away from the city, Gotham would be fine."], ["Would the explosion at sea have caused a tsunami?", "No. In nuclear explosions tested at sea there were no reported tsunami. Potentially there would have been higher waves but nothing significant. Tsunamis are generally caused by earthquakes and/or volcanic activity, and these have the potential to be much, much more powerful than any nuclear weapon. For example, the 2011 Tohoku Earthquake and subsequent tsunami that devastated Japan is believed to have released energy equivalent to 9,320 gigatons of TNT - several orders of magnitude more powerful than the 50 megaton Tsar Bomba (the most powerful nuclear weapon ever built), and certainly more powerful than the 4 megaton nuke featured in this film. When a tsunami is formed, it happens because of seismic activity deep under the ocean's surface. When tectonic plates shift you either have volcanic activity or earthquakes. Because it happens deep below the surface of the water, much more water is displaced than would be by a nuclear blast."], ["How did Batman escape from The Bat and not get killed in the nuclear blast?", "He ejected from the Bat before it flew out over the Bay. Immediately before he boarded the Bat, Selina Kyle suggested that he would eject, but Batman said he could not because the plane had \"no autopilot.\" It turned out, however, that the plane did have autopilot - Bruce Wayne had fixed the autopilot through a software patch, as revealed in Lucius's Fox later scene where he is studying the autopilot software on the silver-colored development prototype Bat. Batman evidently ejected from the plane sometime between boarding it and when the bomb detonated. We actually see him push a lever while in flight, but the scene cuts away before revealing this lever's effect. John Blake and the orphans then view an explosion near a building, followed by the Bat flying over the bay. This explosion would hide Batman's ejection from the public's view. We do not see Batman in the Bat between the explosion and the bomb's detonation. We do see one shot of him, but it is a close-up that does not show the larger Bat. This closeup shows him turning another lever, as though piloting an aircraft, though the Bat traveled a straight path at this point. This shot therefore depicted the ejected cockpit rather than the entire Bat aircraft. Similarly, in The Dark Knight, the Batmobile ejected a self-contained vehicle (the Batpod). Also, if you listen carefully the sound of the engine of the Bat in the scene which was previously mentioned, sounds no mechanical at all (we just hear an electric buzz) although in the following exterior shots, the propellers of the Bat are clearly heard which might indicates that Batman boards a different vehicle with electric engines -different than the propeller-powered Bat- thus proving that he had indeed ejected."], ["Is that the same Bat as Batman's in the scene when Lucius checks for an autopilot patch at the end of the movie?", "No, it isn't. Batman's Bat, which is black colored, was presumably destroyed in the explosion. The machine Lucius checks in the end of the movie is the silver prototype, in which is also shown in the beginning of the film when Bruce was checking out the Applied Sciences department. In that scene, Bruce is touching the grey prototype on the left side of the screen while the audience can see in the background a silver prototype that looks finished on its left side but missing large chunks of parts on its right side and back. Apparently, the grey prototype was finished so he painted it black and gave it to Bruce. At the end of the film, we see that the inspected prototype is silver and still missing its right wing and the right cannon mount isn't shelled up. So Lucius checks this to find any hints of autopilot programming, since the programming would presumably go on all models."], ["Didn't people find it convenient that Batman and Bruce Wayne both died around the same time as each other?", "Bruce Wayne's last public appearance was about two or three days after the stock exchange robbery. He disappears shortly afterwards due to the fact that he was crippled by Bane and taken to the Pit. Since Bruce is not seen in public after this, he, being associated with the \"bourgeoisie\" in Bane's revolution, is assumed to have been killed in the city-wide riots or the kangaroo trials that followed the Bane's takeover. He returns to Gotham less than a day before the bomb detonates, and the only people who see him in the hostage room are Selina, Fox and Miranda, plus the few thugs and hostages present. Batman is then believed dead after he apparently sacrifices himself by flying the bomb out to sea. Since Bruce is assumed killed off sometime in the revolution, a small funeral is held after the detonation attended by those who knew his secret, with the public having no knowledge of this funeral. John Blake, upset with the fact no one else knew Bruce was Batman said, \"no one's ever going to know who saved an entire city.\" So officially, people do not connect the two deaths. Nevertheless, there probably are conspiracy theories about Bruce, stemming back to Batman first appearing at the same time when Bruce Wayne came back from the dead in the 1st film all the way to what happened to Bruce after Lucius took him out of that hostage room in the 3rd film."], ["What does Alfred mean when he says \"I've failed you\" and why did he leave Bruce earlier in the film?", "Alfred said \"I failed you, you trusted me, and I failed you\" to the gravestone of Thomas and Martha Wayne, Bruce's parents. Alfred is overcome with grief from Bruce's death because he had been Bruce's caretaker since Bruce was born, and cared for him after Mr. and Mrs. Wayne died. His parents trusted Alfred to protect Bruce but he didn't since he went along with Bruce as Batman 8 years ago. Thus, when Bruce was going to be Batman again and fight Bane - someone that can outclass and kill him, Alfred didn't want to support Bruce being Batman anymore: \" [Gotham] doesn't need your body, or your life. That time has passed\". Alfred later told Bruce, \"You see only one end to your story. Leaving is all I have to make you understand: you aren't Batman anymore - you have to find another way. You used to talk about finishing. About life beyond that awful cave.\" Alfred tried to convince Bruce that there was more to life than being Batman, but Bruce wanted things to go bad again so he could be Batman. So Alfred threatened to leave so Bruce wouldn't be Batman again. But Bruce shook it off, making Alfred keep his word and leave, and his fears were realized at the end of the film. Consequently, he felt he failed Bruce's parents. In the comics, KnightQuest: The Search, Alfred left Bruce too after he found out he was going to face Bane again --he worried that Bane would beat him again and kill him."], ["Was Selina Kyle wearing Martha Wayne's pearl necklace at the ending cafe scene?", "Yes she was. It was mentioned by Wayne's lawyer after the will reading that a string of pearls was missing from the manifest."], ["Is Alfred dreaming the cafe scene in the end of the movie? If not, how did he happen to cross paths with Bruce?", "No, Alfred is not dreaming. Early in the film, Alfred tells Bruce about a fantasy he had back when Bruce had originally ran away from Gotham for 7 years. Alfred would be on a holiday in Italy, and going to a cafe by the Arno River in Florence every day at noon, and order a Fernet Branca. Every day he would be hoping that he would just happen to come across Bruce there, possibly now with a wife and children. Alfred wouldn't say anything to Bruce, and vice-versa, but Alfred would know that Bruce had made it and started a new life, free from the death, pain and misery that Gotham held for Bruce.\n\nAt the end of the film, Alfred, believing Bruce to be dead, continues with his tradition of going to the cafe in Italy during his holiday. On one particular day, he sees Bruce sitting at the table across from him with Selina Kyle. Alfred nods at Bruce and Bruce nods to Alfred. This might seem too coincidental, hence the suggestion by some that Alfred is simply dreaming it. However, as pointed out by the lawyer near the end of the film saying, \"we can't leave a string of pearls on the manifest as lost\", Martha Wayne's pearl necklace (the one Bruce used to find Selina in the beginning of the film) is missing from Bruce's possessions. Selina can be seen wearing the necklace in the cafe scene, implying that the scene is intended to be real, something which has been confirmed by several sources. Or, Alfred could have found them by using the tracking device on the necklace to find Bruce, since Bruce did the same thing to find Selina earlier in the film.\n\nOther things that need to be taken into account are Fox discovering that Bruce had in fact repaired the Bat's autopilot and Gordon finding the repaired Bat-Signal on the roof of the police station. Alfred had no knowledge of either of these things, and their presence makes it clear that Bruce is in fact alive. But the most simple and logical explanation would be that Bruce found out when Alfred would be on holiday, and found the \"cafe by the Arno [River]\" he always visits. He then went there with Selina to make sure that Alfred would see him, alive and well. It is Bruce's way to make Alfred's wish of seeing Bruce alive and happy come true, as Alfred had been such an important person in his life that he deserved this peace of mind."], ["Would people recognize Bruce living in Europe?", "Probably not. Just like most Americans can't name nor recognize any European billionaire, most Europeans won't recognize American billionaires. Assuming Bruce would be recognized is quite silly and Americentric considering only very few American billionaires are famous worldwide. Carmine Falcone even tells Bruce in Batman Begins that he would have to go a thousand miles to find someone who did not know his name. The only man who ever recognized him outside of Gotham was Ra's but that was only because he had already familiarized himself with Gotham. The people Bruce encountered when he traveled the world as a criminal in Batman Begins didn't recognize him. Additionally, in The Dark Knight, when Bruce was in his prime of persona, the by-passers in Hong Kong did not recognize him when he was taking sightseeing pictures with Lucius since no one stopped, looked, and interrupted them."], ["Will John Blake get trained to fight? What persona will he take on at the end of the film?", "When Batman rescues Blake, we see Blake disarm the man about to shoot him and knocks him out; so Blake already can fight. Nevertheless. considering Bruce left him a bag of goods, we can assume that Bruce left him his future location coordinates in it so Bruce can train him professionally later. Worse-case scenario, Blake could ask Alfred, in who was given half of Wayne Manor, how did Bruce learn to fight and Alfred, having saw Bruce at the cafe with Selina with the pearl necklace, would help locate them for Blake by using the tracking device on it via the Bat computer (similar to how Bruce found Selina in the beginning of the film).\n\nDue to this film being the end of the trilogy, We can speculate who he will be. The theories are;\n\nRobin: At the end of the film, Blake reveals that his first name is Robin. Therefore it would stand to reason that Christopher Nolan was hinting that he would become the Superhero named Robin. However this is the least likely out of the scenarios. After all, becoming a superhero with your first name probably isn't the smartest way to keep your identity secret. After all, Bruce Wayne didn't dress up as a giant bat and call himself \"Bruce\". Also, Robin was always Batman's sidekick and different people took on the persona over the years in the comics; Dick Grayson, Jason Todd, Tim Drake, etc.. John Blake basically acts as Batman's sidekick throughout the film and at the end we find out that his name was Robin.\n\nNightwing: A likely possibility. Nightwing is the persona Dick Grayson took after he became too old to continue on as Robin and went solo. So when John Blake finds the Batcave, he could alter any gadgets or uniforms to his own specifications to become his own superhero. Moreover, the outfit that Blake is wearing at the end of the film, when he enters the cave, is reminiscent of the Nightwing costume from the comics.\n\nBatman: Often accepted by fans as Christopher Nolan's most likely intention at the end of the film. Throughout the film, Bruce Wayne explains to Blake about how Batman is a symbol, the mask is simply to protect those he cares about and that Batman could be anybody. We are also shown Gordon's surprise that the Bat Signal had been mysteriously repaired; meaning he'll have use for it. Also, the final shot of the film shows Blake looking at the Batcave and when he stands on the platform hidden in the water, it rises up and then the film ends. This was likely an allusion to the title of the film, _The Dark Knight Rises_ (qv)."], ["Will there be a sequel to '_The Dark Knight Rises_ (qv)'?", "No. It's been stated that the next Batman film will be a reboot, possibly with Christopher Nolan as producer. However, 'Christian Bale' (qv) has said that he would be willing to return for a fourth Batman film if Nolan came to him with a script (though Bale reportedly turned down $50,000,000.00 to return as Batman in the Nolan-produced Man Of Steel sequel). There are, of course, rumors of a spinoff about Catwoman. 'Anne Hathaway' (qv) has said she is open to such a film, but only if Nolan directs it. As for any rumors about a Robin film, Joseph Gordon-Levitt has also said he is willing to reprise the role on the grounds that Nolan directs."], ["Did the studio make Christopher Nolan change the ending?", "Some people who have seen this film have speculated that Christopher Nolan originally planned for Bruce Wayne to die but that Warner Bros. forced him to write a different ending. However, David Goyer, who wrote or co-wrote the stories for all three films in Nolan's Batman trilogy, said in an interview, \"The final scene of _The Dark Knight Rises_ (qv) is exactly [the] scene we talked about [when Christopher Nolan and I started the trilogy with Batman Begins]. It remained completely unchanged.\" And Nolan himself, in an interview with MTV, said, \"One of the first things I knew about the project is how we were going to end the story.\" The film is also partially based on the series of Batman comics The Dark Knight Returns, in whose finale Batman fakes his own death, and there is even a funeral for Bruce Wayne, much like the film."], ["Why would Christopher Nolan want to end this highly successful series he has created?", "Christopher Nolan decided this chapter should end rather than expand the series. As he only makes room for one film at a time, he wasn't sure he wanted to return to direct a third Batman film, as The Dark Knight was immensely successful and critically acclaimed, so expectations for a third film would undoubtedly be extremely high. Nolan himself said he would not direct a third film unless the script could match or top The Dark Knight. Ideas started to come while in production of Inception, and Nolan made the decision to end his Batman legacy as a trilogy, closing all loose ends with a definitive conclusion. However, 'Christian Bale' (qv) has said that he would be willing to return for a fourth Batman film if Nolan came to him with a script."], ["What reason was given for the Joker's absence in the film?", "Out of respect for the late 'Heath Ledger' (qv), no reason is given in the film for his absence. Christopher Nolan said, \"We're not addressing the Joker at all. That is something I felt very strongly about in terms of my relationship with Heath and the experience I went through with him on The Dark Knight. I didn't want to, in any way, try and account for a real-life tragedy. That seemed inappropriate to me. We just have a new set of characters and a continuation of Bruce Wayne's story not involving The Joker.\""], ["Was there a four-hour version of this movie that was cut down to 2:44 before it was released?

I don't think I'd want to sit through a four-hour version of this movie! As a writer-director, it's pretty easy for me to be rigorous and precise about the running time of the film...and I think with each film I've told the studio exactly how long it was going to be two years ahead of time.\" The rumor apparently came from what the editors of MTV's website later described as \"a humorous exaggeration\" in a March, 2012 article on their site; before the article was revised, it referred to a \"four-hour rough cut\" of the movie. The rumor also came from that his brother's rough draft of the script was 400 pages long. However, Christopher made his own 165 page shooting script based on it. And we can assume the rough draft was that long since its based of Tale of Two Cities - a novel that is around 400 pages long. The rumor is also debunked, because the film's shooting script is relatively the same as what was shown in theaters. In terms of what was cut out of the movie, only redundant dialogue was cut out. In terms of Bane's backstory, only a short scene of Bane training out of Ra's Al Ghul was cut out.

However, Bruce goes to another board member, Miranda Tate, and asks her to take control of the company in order to keep the fusion reactor program safe from the world until it can be fixed.\n\nStep 7: At this point, Daggett has out-lived his usefulness and Bane kills him.\n\nStep 8: Bane faces off against Batman, revealing that he knows Batman's true identity. Bane reveals his base is set up directly underneath Wayne Enterprises' Research and Development facility, giving Bane and his men full access to all of Batman's weapons, gadgets, and vehicles. Bane continues to brutally beat Batman and eventually defeats him.\n\nStep 9: Bane takes the wounded Bruce Wayne to an undisclosed part of the world and places him in a pit prison which Bane describes as \"the worst hell on Earth\". Bane then reveals he will let Bruce live only to torture his soul, by terrorizing Gotham, and feeding the people just enough hope to survive, then he will obliterate them, while forcing Bruce to watch it all from prison.\n\nStep 10: Bane crashes a Wayne Enterprises board meeting and takes Lucius Fox, Miranda Tate and Fredericks down to the facility where the fusion reactor is kept and forces them to activate it.\n\nStep 11: Bane makes Dr. Pavel turn the fusion reactor into a neutron bomb. Bane removes the core, causing the reactor to become unstable; effectively turning it into a time-bomb with a five-month fuse.\n\nStep 12: Daggett\u00b4s construction crews have been repairing different parts of the city using some kind of mix between explosives and cement, Bane sets off dozens of explosives around the main island of Gotham, taking out all but one bridge and destroying the football stadium during a game, also trapping thousands of Gotham City cops in underground tunnels. He then reveals to the world the bomb and that Dr. Pavel is the only one capable of defusing it. Then Bane breaks Pavel's neck on TV and reveals that nobody must resist them or try and escape because an ordinary citizen in the city holds the trigger and will detonate the bomb if anyone tries.\n\nStep 13: Bane reads Commissioner Gordon's confession about covering up Harvey Dent's crimes on live television. He then releases the inmates of Blackgate Prison to join his cause.\n\nStep 14: Bane effectively takes control of Gotham City, allowing kangaroo courts for loose ends (such as Stryver), the rich, decadent and corrupt. Martial law is put in effect and maintains control for over 4 months. Bane then waits, counting down the time until the bomb goes off.\n\nStep 15: Batman returns to stop Bane. It is then revealed that both Bane and Miranda Tate were the masterminds behind the whole plot because Miranda is actually Ra's Al Ghul's daughter, Talia, and wanted vengeance against Bruce Wayne for killing her father and foiling his plan to destroy Gotham. Bane, while excommunicated by Ra's Al Ghul, was a loyal friend and protector to Talia and willingly executed the plan."]], "0118715": [["A Note Regarding Spoilers", "The following FAQ entries may contain spoilers.

After the commercial success of the original _Star Wars_ (qv), Lucas was able to continue with the multi-film epic he originally envisioned. The first sequel, The Empire Strikes Back, was released in 1980 and bore the full title of \"_Star Wars_ (qv), Episode V, The Empire Strikes Back\" in the title crawl, although it was referred to only as \"The Empire Strikes Back\" as the title of its commercial release.

While the film does not specify, the novelization of the film indicates to what academy Luke and his uncle were referring. A deleted scene wherein Luke talks with his recently graduated friend Biggs indicates that Biggs was planning, along with several friends, to jump ship and seek out the Rebel Alliance after beginning their tours of duty on the vessel Rand Ecliptic. Luke already knows this information when he has the discussion with his uncle, but the text of the missing scene, as well as Luke's later talk with Ben Kenobi, show that Luke was very uncertain of the idea of joining with the Alliance despite his voiced opposition to the Galactic Empire and likely was not desiring to attend the Academy for the same reasons as his friend (though Biggs did not necessarily go to the Academy with the intention of joining the Alliance and may have heard about it while in school and decided where his true loyalties lay).\n\nLuke views the Academy as his likeliest chance to make a life for himself away from home. In the course of the film, it is never specified exactly what is taught at \"the academy\", which might simply be a name for a general college. Biggs seems to have trained as a fighter pilot there, suggesting that it is a military academy, or something akin to the United States Reserve Officers Training Corps (ROTC). The Empire, like other totalitarian states, seems to have taken over all educational institutions. Both Luke and Biggs probably have no great sympathy for the Empire, but they have no other educational options. Luke's desire to leave his home for school in search of a better future is similar to the themes explored in Lucas' previous film, _American Graffiti (1973)_ (qv). By virtue of that, it might be that the name and type of academy is left vague intentionally in the film to imply that it does not matter.\n\nAlthough Luke had no official training as a pilot, he had developed sufficient piloting skills in his spare time on Tatooine (as mentioned by Ben Kenobi). In fact, in Marvel's _Star Wars_ (qv) comic series, a younger Luke Skywalker is shown to be quite the adept T-16 pilot. In order to aid the Alliance as much as possible, he was allowed to join the Rebel assault on the DeathStar despite his lack of formal training. However, his old friend Biggs vouched for him to Red Leader, calling Luke \"the best bush pilot in the Outer Rim Territories.\" As he had never been through any combat training, one can only attribute his abilities in battle to an innate skill, or his sensitivity to the Force, or (as in the case of his father) both."], ["If Luke is supposed to be hidden from the Empire, why was he given the name \"Skywalker\"?", "It would, at first, seem unwise for Obi-Wan to hide a child with his adoptive parents and give him the same surname as the father from whom he was trying to hide the child. However, there are more sides to the story. In the film, the first time Luke is identified by his whole name is many scenes after he has agreed to go with Obi-Wan to Alderaan, so the audience cannot assume that he has always gone by the name of \"Skywalker\". Furthermore, as seen in the third prequel, Revenge of the Sith, Luke was delivered to Owen and Beru Lars by Obi-Wan Kenobi. We never learned what Obi-Wan has told them about Luke's family history.\n\nOwen and Beru already knew that Anakin was a Jedi (having met him themselves in the second prequel, Attack of the Clones; but what Obi-Wan probably did not tell them was that Anakin had joined the Emperor, that Luke could one day destroy the Emperor and that Luke should therefore stay hidden from the Emperor (and, as Obi-Wan would later discover, Anakin/Vader too). If they had known, then Luke would certainly have been called \"Lars\", like his adoptive parents (just as Leia got her adoptive parents' name), to hide his ancestry. It may also have caused his uncle and aunt to take more extreme measures to keep Luke hidden, and if the truth about Luke was ever divulged by accident, the wrong people might have found out (since the Empire has spies everywhere surveying for a number of specific crucial things). Obi-Wan still needed Luke, believing that Luke might be the one to fulfill the prophecy of bringing balance to the Force. Owen and Beru were thus probably kept out of the loop, while Kenobi stuck around to made sure Luke would be safe and hear the truth when the time was right.\n\nObi-Wan probably told them that both Anakin and Padm\u00e9 were killed in the Clone Wars, and that Owen and Beru were now Luke's only family. He may have added that: Luke might want to become a Jedi like his father one day and he could train with Obi-Wan. Obi-Wan rightly assumed that Tatooine was remote enough from the Empire for him not to be detected accidentally, so there would be no reason to give Luke a different name (the name \"Skywalker\" being already known from Luke's grandmother, Shmi, and not something to have raised questions on Tatooine).\n\nFrom Obi-Wan's dialogue in the film, it appears that Owen assumed that Anakin died in the line of duty, and did not approve of Anakin's career as a reckless Jedi (\"He [your uncle] didn't hold with your father's ideals. Thought he should have stayed here and not gotten involved\"). Owen certainly did not want Luke to follow that same path (\"Your father wanted you to have this [lightsaber] when you were old enough, but your uncle wouldn't allow it. He feared you might follow old Obi-Wan on some damn fool idealistic crusade like your father did\"). He therefore told Luke that Anakin had been a navigator on a spice freighter, and warned him stay away from Obi-Wan (\"That wizard's just a crazy old man\"). The opposite is true of Leia, as her father is an important figure in the Rebel Alliance. Although Leia was never told about her true heritage; her father knew to keep her hidden from the Empire, and he even groomed her for an active role within the Rebel Alliance.\n\nIn the _Star Wars_ (qv) comics released by Marvel, since Revenge of the Sith came out, a number of \"side stories\" have been released, showing Obi-Wan on Tatooine, looking over young Luke. In Obi-Wan's encounters with Owen Lars, it is clear that Owen does hold Obi-Wan responsible for Anakin's fate (exactly how much Owen was told is unclear) but he makes it clear that he does not want Anakin's son embarking down a similarly dangerous path."], ["Why doesn't Obi-Wan remember the droids?", "The only thing Obi-Wan ever says is that he doesn't \"seem to remember ever owning a droid.\" This does not imply that he isn't familiar with them, merely that Luke saying \"Then the droid does belong to you\" is an untrue statement. It's possible that, as with other secrets, Obi-Wan doesn't reveal quite everything at first blush, and that what he does reveal could be seen as true from certain points of view. The whole setup is a lie from R2-D2, who claims to be the property of Obi-Wan, when in fact he's been in the possession of the Organas (and the Alliance) for a long time. R2's lie is just to get off the homestead and on with his mission. It's entirely possible that Obi-Wan does not recognize these droids at all. In the case of C-3PO, Obi-Wan and the protocol droid never meet until the Clone Wars, and even then, those meetings are likely infrequent between a Jedi on the front lines of a war and the protocol droid of a galactic senator. After a scant few scenes together in Revenge of the Sith, Obi-Wan and 3PO part ways for the next 19 year. Likewise, R2 and Obi-Wan have minimal history together, starting with R2 just being one of the astromechs aboard the Queen's starship in Episode I and moving along to sharing all of one scene together in Episode II. The Clone Wars and Revenge of the Sith see the two meeting again occasionally, but R2's always Anakin's droid. They too part ways not to see each other for 19 years. Some faces of occasional acquaintances fade over time in real life, and the same could be said for the _Star Wars_ (qv) universe. Worse, these droids are dime-a-dozen models, regularly seen throughout the galaxy. Especially without the droids mentioning their names (a point true when Obi-Wan delivers the line in question; in fact, 3PO isn't even directly present at the time), Obi-Wan recalling an R2 unit or protocol droid as a specific one he's worked with 19 years after the fact has about the same likelihood as someone from our time picking their specific iPhone 5 out of a lineup of identical phones almost twenty years later."], ["Why does Obi-Wan claim that he hasn't gone by the name of \"Obi-Wan\" since before Luke's birth?", "As we see in Revenge of the Sith; Obi-Wan is referred to as \"Master Kenobi\" by Yoda after Luke's birth, but no one ever called him 'Ben' before that time, so it may be puzzling to hear him say otherwise in A New Hope. However, there are several explanations for this. The most technical would be that the chronology of the _Star Wars_ (qv) saga was far from established at the time when the first movie was made. Lucas did not fully know how his saga would evolve, so he had no firmly established ideas about Obi-Wan Kenobi's back story yet. (In certain story drafts, Obi-Wan was even Owen Lars' brother, a fact offhandedly mentioned in the novelization of Return of the Jedi.) Kenobi's history gradually became more fleshed out during the production of the next five movies, and Lucas may have made changes along the way that sometimes deviated from what had been established earlier. This discrepancy may simply reflect the improvisational nature of the writing process. As an in-story explanation, one could argue that Kenobi has been on Tatooine for 19 years; assuming the name of \"Ben\" for a long time already, he may simply have forgotten when he exactly stopped using the name \"Obi-Wan\". He could also mean it in a symbolic way: Obi-Wan was his name by which his fellow Jedi used to call him. In the years when he had served in the Clone Wars before Luke was born, he was addressed as \"Master Kenobi\" or \"General Kenobi\" more often. He may have meant to say that he has been more of a soldier and a simple hermit than a Jedi for the last decades.\n\nThere is another important reason, which may tie in to the questions why Kenobi lies about Luke's father, the lightsaber and possibly also about not recognizing R2-D2 and C-3PO: Kenobi could tell Luke the truth, that he stopped using the name Obi-Wan just after Luke's birth, but such a coincidence would only increase Luke's curiosity. It would raise many questions from Luke, forcing Obi-Wan to admit he was present at Luke's birth, how he brought Luke to his uncle and aunt, and what really happened to his father, all information he is not yet ready to reveal. Therefore, Kenobi stays vague about this, acknowledging that he knew Anakin, but remaining silent about Anakin's fate, and his own part in this."], ["Exactly what is the Force?", "Obi-wan describes the Force as \"an energy field created by all living things. It surrounds us, penetrates us, and binds the galaxy together.\" It's the Force that gives the Jedi his powers. The Force may be conceived of as being similar to concepts of \"life force\" as found in many ancient cultures of this world, i.e., e.g., \"chi\" (\u6c23) (\"qi\" in China) (\"ki\" in Japan), prana (\u092a\u094d\u0930\u093e\u0923) in India, Wakan Tanka or the Great Spirit in various Native American cultures."], ["Why exactly was the Empire so bad?", "The Empire was an oppressive regime which overtook The Old Republic. The Empire would strip certain planets of their resources, effectively polluting and destroying them. They would also enslave the populations of these planets. One example is the Chewbacca's homeworld of Kashyyyk. The Empire reached the pinnacle of their oppressiveness with the creation of the Death Star. A super weapon capable of destroying an entire planet. Intending to use fear to keep anyone from considering a rebellion."], ["Why does Obi-Wan lie about Anakin's lightsaber?", "One could conclude that perhaps Anakin had at some time spoken of having a child and wanting that child to follow in his footsteps, but given the strict Jedi Code which forbade this (as revealed in the prequels), that would seem an unlikely desire/admission. Perhaps the best way to summarise what Obi-Wan really meant would be to say that: Obi-Wan knew that Luke would be the only hope of destroying the Emperor, and he himself wanted Luke to one day have the weapon and become a Jedi. But by telling Luke this was his father's wish and not his own, he knew Luke would be more drawn to taking the weapon. Or it could be that Obi-Wan honestly felt that this is what Anakin would have wanted. A central feature of both confrontations between Luke and Vader is Obi-Wan's trustworthiness, first about what really happened to Luke's father, then about having hidden Leia. Here Obi-Wan is again acting in the name of Anakin's good side. Alternately, he might simply wish to keep the truth of Luke's parentage secret for the time being, preferring for Luke to have fond feelings toward his father, the man Obi-Wan knew before Anakin's fall to the dark side. It could be assumed that based on their close friendship, Obi-Wan was projecting what he believed his friend Anakin would have wanted prior to turning to the dark side of the Force. Obi-Wan speaks of Anakin and Vader as if they are two completely separate people. He may truly feel that what he is telling Luke is the truth \"from a certain point of view.\""], ["Who actually shot first in the cantina: Greedo or Han?", "In the original release, Han shot first before Greedo ever even pressed the trigger of his blaster, so in reality Greedo never even got the chance to shoot\u2014we see Han slyly drawing his own blaster during the conversation and when he shoots Greedo, we get a closeup of Greedo's face that disappears in a flash of flames. In the Special Edition and subsequent versions, Greedo's actions were retconned in that laser bolts were added as he raised his blaster. This newly inserted blaster shot missed which was then followed by Han's original deadly blaster shot. This revised scene has been presented thus far in three different ways. The 1997 theatrical release and subsequent VHS release allowed a rather slack amount of time between Greedo firing and Han returning fire. For the 2004 DVD release, the lag time was removed, with the characters firing very nearly at the same time. The Blu-ray release cut the scene even tighter-we now do not even see Greedo's pistol discharge; his laser bolt is already traversing the shot as it begins, with Han firing only a frame or so later."], ["Why does the Jabba scene almost precisely repeat what was said in the Greedo scene?", "In terms of the film, it could be said that it is possible that while Jabba knew that Han had shot Greedo in the cantina, he was not aware of the details of the conversation Han had with him. Therefore, if Jabba makes a similar comment to what Greedo said about dumping his shipment. He would get a similar answer. Also, it adds a bit more humour where Han uses the exact same excuse word-for-word with Jabba that he did with Greedo: \"Even I get boarded sometimes. Do you think I had a choice?\", showing what a smooth-talker Han is.\n\nThe scene with Greedo in the original shoot was much shorter and did not contain the dialogue revolving around Han's dumping of stolen goods meant for Jabba. When the decision was made to cut the Jabba scene out, owing to the time and funds needed to add the desired stop-motion creature, a new version of the Greedo scene was filmed, this time using a female performer in the costume, which added the needed exposition that would have otherwise been lost. (During the interim, a method was found for articulating the snout of the Greedo mask by having the performer hold a clothespin in her mouth; one may notice that the shot wherein Greedo first confronts Han and forces him to sit does not feature the alien's mouth moving during its dialogue.)\n\nIn the original 1976 shoot, Jabba was actually played by a short, rotund man ('Declan Mulholland' (qv)), with the intention of changing the character (either through stop-motion or more traditional animation) into an alien. When the Special Edition was being compiled in 1995, ILM artists realised that Han walks around Jabba when talking, and decided to fix this potential problem by making Han step on Jabba's tail. The image of 'Harrison Ford' (qv) in the shot was lifted digitally, resulting in a somewhat jarring motion. Another clue as to Jabba's original form is when Han says \"Jabba, you're a wonderful human being.\" With Jabba now being an alien, the line becomes a wry joke on Han's behalf. Some of the original footage from this scene can be found in the television special From _Star Wars_ (qv) To Jedi and before the feature of the _Star Wars_ (qv) (Special Edition) VHS cassette. When the decision was made to restore the Jabba scene, too many years had passed to have 'Harrison Ford' (qv) record new lines; therefore, the scene appears as it was originally scripted, redundant dialogue and all."], ["What are the little silver sticks that Imperial Officers wear on their lapels?", "These are Imperial code cylinders.

After his death in the first prequel, The Phantom Menace; Qui-Gon Jinn gained the ability to live on and observe events from within the Force (which is why we can hear him crying out after the Sand People are slaughtered in the second prequel, Attack of the Clones). Yoda is actually communicating with him as Obi-Wan returns with the dying Padm\u00e9 in Revenge of the Sith (Qui-Gon's voice was reportedly recorded but ultimately deleted). In this missing scene, Qui-Gon states, \"The ability to defy oblivion can be achieved, but only for oneself. It was accomplished by a Shaman of the Whills. It is a state acquired through compassion, not greed\"; hence when Obi-Wan tells Vader, \"If you strike me down, I shall become more powerful than you can possibly imagine\", he refers to the fact that he can achieve what Anakin gave up his good side in search of. During their exile periods on Dagobah and Tatooine respectively, Yoda and Obi-Wan communicate with Qui-Gon and learn the ability to be absorbed into the Force at the time of their deaths; living on as translucent, hazy blue ghosts.\n\nIt does not seem to be essential, however; since both Anakin and Qui-Gon live on through the Force without being absorbed, though arguably Qui-Gon's ghost never appears and Anakin's never speaks (but, to be fair, in the only scene in which Anakin's ghost appears, nobody else, including Obi-Wan and Yoda, speaks either), so their influences could be weaker. (According to the missing scene, Yoda likely sees Qui-Gon as they communicate, and it is only the audience who cannot see him. Similarly, at the Rebels' party at the end of the second sequel, Return of the Jedi; Luke can see the three ghosts, but Leia\u2014not to mention everybody else\u2014cannot. In the sequel, The Empire Strikes Back, the audience seeing and hearing what Luke does; in Yoda's hut, Luke overhears Obi-Wan talking to Yoda, and quite possibly, Yoda can see him, but Luke cannot.)\n\nPerhaps Qui-Gon was only able to manifest his voice into the minds of fellow Jedi after his death. [Obi-Wan does exactly the same thing in _Star Wars_ (qv), as he does not appear visually to Luke until The Empire Strikes Back. This may reflect the evolution of the story in 'George Lucas' (qv)' mind, or perhaps Luke's developing perception of the Force, whereby Luke's first vision comes only in a delirious, semi-conscious state, but later he is able to see Obi-Wan clearly, and even to carry on detailed arguments with him. Anakin, when he first experiences Qui-Gon's voice (like Luke when he first experiences Obi-Wan's voice), is not a fully trained Jedi. Also, he (like Luke) is in the heat of battle, and does not have the inner calm necessary for good communication.] Appearing as a Jedi spirit may have required training during life which he had never received. But he was able to pass on this knowledge, so Yoda and Obi-Wan could have maximum benefit from it. Darth Vader witnessed Obi-Wan disappearing upon death, which may have prompted him to seek out this ability for himself during the times he was meditating inside his regeneration hub (seen in The Empire Strikes Back). With Darth Vader being possibly the most powerful user of the Force, it is not unthinkable that he could master the ability himself, perhaps even communicating with Qui-Gon's spirit (although this is pure speculation). However, he could only ever use it after turning from the dark side of the Force. After Anakin's death, it took a while for him to be completely on the light side of the Force, and perhaps his body disappeared during his cremation (or after). If this is also true for Qui-Gon, that means his ashy remains would have finally disappeared years after his death. (By the tale end of Return of the Jedi, it seems that Anakin was taught by Yoda and Obi Wan, just as Qui-Gon was taught after death.)"], ["Why would Han Solo say he didn't believe in the Jedi when he was old enough to remember the fall of the Republic?", "Han Solo never said he didn't believe in the Jedi. He simply didn't believe that the Jedi had supernatural powers, as he never witnessed them for himself. There were approximately ten thousand Jedi at the end of the Order. In the vast expanse of the galaxy, it's extremely unlikely Han ever met any of them, especially seeing as how he would have only been roughly 9 years old when the Republic fell."], ["Did Darth Vader intend to allow the Millennium Falcon escape?", "Princess Leia observes that the Imperial forces allowed them to escape the Death Star in order to track them to the Rebel base and this is later confirmed in the conversation between Darth Vader and Grand Moff Tarkin ('Peter Cushing' (qv)). However, Vader is intent on facing Obi-Wan in single combat and it seems doubtful that the Imperial stormtroopers or TIE fighter pilots were in on the plan, so the perils faced by the heroes are likely quite real. So it's likely that Tarkin ordered a small contingent of TIE fighters to destroy the Falcon. Had they destroyed it, the Death Star plans and Princess Leia would be destroyed. If they got away, they would reveal the location of the Rebel base; either way would work out for Tarkin, though it was \"An awful risk...\" as he puts it. His clear uncertainty regarding the plan seems to indicate that it was Vader's idea, rather than his own."], ["Did a stormtrooper really hit his head on a door frame in the Death Star?", "Yes. During the scene where our heroes are caught in the trash compactor and are being aided by the droids R2-D2 and C-3PO via comlink, a group of Imperial stormtroopers manage to break into the control room where the droids are stationed. If you look at the stormtrooper on the right as he's rushing the door with the other troopers his height is too tall for the door frame so unfortunately he hits his head and it snaps back but like a trained trooper he recovers quickly and finishes the break in with the rest of the troopers. The stormtrooper hitting his head was actually a blooper and when _Star Wars_ (qv) was released on DVD a thumping sound effect, which was not in the original release, (as well as the sound of another trooper saying 'Need a hand?') was added as the trooper hits his head. (In Attack of the Clones, Jango Fett bumps his own head on the hatch of Slave I when he and Boba are leaving Camino after his battle with Obi-Wan. The gag was included as an homage to the original blooper.)"], ["Why is the Death Star just becoming operational, when the construction started 19 years before?", "We see the beginning of the Death Star's construction at the end of Revenge of the Sith. As _Star Wars_ (qv) officially takes place 19 years later, we may wonder why it took the Galactic Empire so long to get it built. It is especially confusing in Return of the Jedi, in which a second, larger and fully operational (though incomplete), Death Star was shown, no more than four years having passed since the destruction of the first. The obvious source for the answer would be creator 'George Lucas' (qv). During the commentary track on the DVD release of Attack of the Clones, he briefly addresses the matter, and suggests that the Empire may have had problems with contractors and construction workers who were hired to build the first Death Star (who were mostly Geonosians, since they designed the station in the first place). It should be noted that he may be referring in a tongue-in-cheek way to the famous dialogue from the movie _Clerks (1994)_ (qv), in which the characters discussed the issue of contractors and workers being involved in the construction of both Death Stars and dying in the destruction of the second station. Joke or not, this could of course be a good reason why the construction of the first Death Star slowed down. Remember that it was still a prototype, so perhaps there were problems with the supply of materials, difficulties in implementing the new technology, lack of engineers, inexperience, growing pains in the mechanisms (like computer system glitches and bugs), attacks by rebels, etc.\n\nThe video game '_Star Wars_ (qv): Battlefront II' features a story mode that contains a mission of sabotage toward the first Death Star before the events of _Star Wars_ (qv), though this is obviously an after-the-fact rationalization not originally considered when Lucas was writing the story. This may go some way towards explaining why the second Death Star was constructed much faster: it was no longer a prototype, and although production of a Death Star does not seem exactly like assembly work, previous experience may have significantly sped up construction. And although operational, it was still far from completed. Another consideration is that it is not literally stated that the construction of Death Star II was started after the destruction of the first, and perhaps the Empire had already started building a second one while the first one was being finished -- perhaps the plan was to build several of them that would be stationed a key points throughout the galaxy. The architects must have considerably reworked the original plans, because the design flaw in the first Death Star (that it can be destroyed by firing a simple torpedo in the exhaust port) was eliminated in the second one. It is possible that the end of Revenge of the Sith, where Vader and the Emperor are looking upon the construction of the Death Star, took place some time after the other events shown in the end. There is, however, nothing in the scene to suggest this, nor any precedent for scenes in a _Star Wars_ (qv) film being presented as flashforwards or flashbacks.\n\nA more factual line of logical conjecture would be that it should come as no surprise that when it takes years to build an aircraft carrier, it should take a little longer to build something the size of a moon, especially since it was supposed to be a secret construction project (hard to hide a new moon, or the sudden disappearance of a million zero-g construction workers). As for why the second was built so much faster, why build just one when you can build two almost as easily? The hard parts were fabrication of new dies and tech. Once you can make something the first time, you just have to put a nominal cost into making a duplicate of all the new parts. Ultimately, having several Death Stars throughout the galaxy could only aid the Empire in achieving its goal of dominating the entire galaxy through intimidation."], ["What exactly were the steps in Palpatine's plot in this film?", "Although Palpatine, the Emperor, was not featured in this film, it is mentioned by Grand Moff Tarkin that the Emperor has dissolved the Imperial Senate permanently, that the regional governors will now have direct control over their \"territories\" and that fear of the Death Star will keep the local systems in line. This means that during the first nineteen years of his reign, the Emperor kept the Senate intact in order to maintain the appearance that the people still had a certain amount of power (a ploy also used by Roman emperors); however in reality, the Senate probably had increasingly less to say, up to the point where the Emperor had so much military power that he could dismiss the Senate without much resistance."], ["Why does Grand Moff Tarkin give orders to Vader? Doesn't Vader outrank him?", "In the mythos of the _Star Wars_ (qv) franchise, any Sith immediately outranks any member of the Imperials. However, that was back before the \"Rule of Two\" was introduced into the stories. It is possible that the Emperor was impressed with Tarkin's ruthlessness and ability to command the Imperial forces and so he is considered an equal to Vader, or simply the supreme commander of the Imperial forces, whereas Vader technically has no military rank (yet), just Lord and special servant to the Emperor (like Darth Maul was to Darth Sidious in The Phantom Menace. Tarkin never really gives Vader orders, but he simply tells him to release General Motti from his telekinetic choke and to terminate Leia. Vader and Tarkin obviously have a long history together, so Vader respects Tarkin enough to honour his requests: \"As you wish.\" Any other scenes with Vader and Tarkin, they converse as if equals and Tarkin even refers to Vader as \"my friend\".\n\nIn the new canon novel Tarkin, the majority of which takes place roughly 5 years after the end of the clone wars. Emperor Palpatine, foreseeing how important they will both be to the Empire, sends Tarkin and Vader on a mission together. Much to their chagrin. During the mission, Vader comes to admire and respect Tarkin's fearless and brilliant combat tactics. Likewise, Tarkin respects Vader's abilities to wield the power of the force and even suspects that Vader is actually Anakin Skywalker (though he knows better than to ask), whom he came to respect as a Jedi during the clone wars. By the end of the novel, Tarkin is named Grand Moff. Making him one of the most powerful men in the galaxy, second only to The Emperor and Vader. Vader comes to respect him as a an equal and a friend. As close to a friend as Vader could have anyway."], ["How does the movie end?", "Pursued by Vader and two wingmen, Luke flies his X-Wing snubfighter down the Death Star trench. Suddenly, Han and the Millenium Falcon appear. Han shoots down one of Vader's wingmen. Distracted, the remaining wing ship crashes into Vader's ship and ricochets into the trench wall where it explodes. Vader's ship spins out of control. Han informs Luke that he is clear to fire on the exhaust port. Calling on the strength of the Force, Luke fires his proton torpedoes, hitting the port perfectly and causing the Death Star to explode, killing Tarkin and most of the senior Imperial staff before they could fire on the Rebel base. Following the successful destruction of the Death Star, Luke and Han head back to the Rebel base. Heavily damaged by Vader's hit on Luke's ship, R2D2 is sent for repairs while 3-CPO expresses his concern for his droid friend. In the final scene, Luke and Han are awarded medals for bravery by Princess Leia, while Chewabacca, 3-CPO, and a newly-repaired R2D2 applaud, along with hundreds of Rebel soldiers at an awards ceremony held in their honor."], ["Why is there such a serious flaw in the Death Star?", "Keep in mind, the Death Star is a space station the size of a small moon. Which means it's massive. The intricate workings of such a design could have several glitches and flaws that would go unnoticed. One specific thermal exhaust port leads right to the main reactor. There could be tens of thousands of exhaust ports on the station. In Rogue One, it is explained that Galen Erso realized that the Death Star would be completed with or without his expertise, so he decided to play along and continue his work in building the Death Star's super weapon. However, [spoiler]he worked in a design flaw that would destroy the station but would go unnoticed by the Empire.[/spoiler]"], ["How were the lightsaber effects created?", "The first lightsaber effects were created using wooden dowel rods wrapped in Scotchlite (a reflective white material used for lettering on road signs for night visibility) which were attached to the saber hilts. The hilts contained small motors which would spin the rod, which would reflect a front-projected light source, causing a shimmering effect. The activation and deactivation of the lightsabers were accomplished by simply stopping the camera with the actor (usually) standing still and attaching or removing the rod before restarting the camera, resulting in a slight jump in the image. This approach was not entirely successful for a number of reasons. It was hoped that the reflective surface would cast ambient light on the saber's immediate surroundings, but this was rarely if ever noticeable. The brightness of the saber could vary drastically depending upon its angle relative to the front-projected light, and additionally, the wooden blades were very fragile and tended to break during the dueling scenes. A few of these in-camera effects found their way into the film's first teaser trailer. The in-camera approach not culminating in satisfactory results, ILM added an animated glow to the blades in post-production, now differentiating the color of the individual sabers, which had all previously been white. For unknown reasons, two separate shots (one of Obi-Wan's saber and one of Vader's) did not have this effect applied, and the shots appeared in the finished film with the characters holding plain white sticks. This discrepancy was finally addressed in the DVD release of the film.\n\nTwo shots appearing in the film differed from this approach. The first scene of Luke training aboard the Millennium Falcon featured a completely animated blade. Without a practical blade attached to the hilt for reference, the saber beam appears slightly unsteady in this shot. The shot in which Obi-wan activates his saber as he prepares to confront Vader, the only instance in the original film wherein the saber is seen to slowly extend from the hilt as it would in all subsequent films, was achieved by attaching a glass rod to the hilt, initially pointed directly at the camera. Alec Guiness turned his hand slightly in the course of the shot, causing reflected light to travel along the length of the tube and give the effect of of an extruding blade. Again, a rotoscoped glow was eventually added for a more dynamic visual effect. All subsequent films in the series dispensed with the Scotchlite approach completely, and the sabers were equipped with sturdier metal rods for both dueling and as guides for the animated blades."], ["Were the Biggs and Luke scenes on Tatooine originally part of the finished film?", "They were supposedly never part of any release of the film, having been edited out of the film long before the special effects, sound, and musical score were completed, and long before the first test screening. Though many fans claim to have seen them (as children, or on televised versions), they were never officially available until the CD-ROM \"Behind the Magic\" was released in the mid 1990s. Some photos from those scenes did, however, appear in books, such as The _Star Wars_ (qv) Storybook, and the Marvel comic book adaptation. Lucas has said that these scenes were only added after he showed the script to friends, who told him that he waited too long (almost twenty minutes) to introduce the main character of Luke Skywalker. Lucas felt it would be best to follow the droids until their story connected with Luke, but he gave in to his friends' criticisms and added these new scenes. Soon after assembling a cut of the film, he realized these new scenes slowed down the pace of the opening section, so he edited them back out again. Also, one member of a private test screening upset Lucas by joking that these scenes made it look like \"American Graffiti in space\", and these comparisons were something he was desperate to avoid."], ["What are the differences between the original theatrical release and the Special Edition?", "In 1997, Lucas re-released the original _Star Wars_ (qv) trilogy.

Additionally, tiny sound alterations are audible as well, including the reinstatement of the \"Force theme\" heard as the X-Wings dive at the Death Star (which had been mixed out in the DVD version), and last but not least, the Solo-Greedo scene was edited too, the gap between the blaster shots being reduced again. A detailed comparison between both versions with pictures can be found here and here."], ["What is the definitive version of the film?", "Lucas has stated that the more recent versions of the original trilogy are the \"definitive\" versions. He quoted a statement among moviemakers, \"movies are not finished, they are abandoned\", and added that he himself decided not to abandon his movies, but properly finish them. The reason for this is because at the time the original films were made (1977, 1980, and 1983), the technology to bring Lucas' true vision to the screen simply did not exist and the cost to realize it would have been astronomical. So with the technology available in the late 1990s through the 2000s; Lucas was able to touch-up, re-envision or create from scratch scenes from his original trilogy. On the flip-side, many die-hard _Star Wars_ (qv) fans disagree with many of the changes or additions that Lucas made to his original trilogy (the most infamous being Greedo shooting at Han) and consider the original theatrical releases of the films the definitive \"perfect\" versions of the movies.

Those who do remember the journey are often overcome with profound remorse for the regretful actions buried within their dreams...\" This is seen in the film during the \"Mad World\" sequence when Jim Cunningham wakes up sobbing with what appears to be guilt. To further prove this, hidden on DonnieDarkoFilm.com is a newspaper article about Jim Cunningham's suicide, which occurs in the Primary Universe on October 12, 1988, just days after Donnie's death. Cunningham's suicide took place on the fourteenth hole of the Sarasota Heights Country Club golf course, which is where he first met Donnie.\n\nAlso, Donnie did not fail in revealing him as a criminal because that was never his main goal. Frank told Donnie to burn down Cunningham's house, which eventually led to the discovery of his kiddie porn dungeon. This leads Mrs. Farmer to go to Cunningham's defence instead of on the trip with Sparkle Motion, causing Rose Darko to go on the trip instead, which allows Donnie and Elizabeth to throw a party. Frank leaves this party to get more beer and has to drive by Grandma Death's house on the way back, which is where Frank runs over Gretchen and Donnie kills Frank. Without this party, Gretchen wouldn't have been killed. So, according to the Philosophy of Time Travel, since the Ensurance Trap (Gretchen's death, caused by Frank) was successful, the Living Receiver (Donnie) is left with no choice but to use his Fourth Dimensional Power to send the Artifact back in time into the Primary Universe before the Black Hole collapses upon itself.

Should Brand succeed, NASA will be able to defy our traditional understanding of physics and launch an enormous space station, carrying the remainder of Earth's surviving population into space. The very facility that Cooper and Murph stumble upon at the beginning of the film isn't just a NASA research station, it's a construction site for humankind's space-traveling ark.\n\nPlan B:  Should Brand fail in his calculation and/or the Endurance take too much time investigating potential homeworlds, NASA has harvested a bank of fertilized human embryos that can be used to ensure humanity's survival after everyone on Earth becomes extinct. To ensure genetic diversity, NASA procured DNA from a wide range of sources so that future generations would not be limited to reproduction between Endurance crew members. In this scenario, the Endurance team would settle down on the most habitable planet and raise the first generation of embryos, with each subsequent generation helping to raise a new set of embryos (as well as reproducing naturally)."], ["Does Einstein's theory of relativity imply that interstellar space travel is impossible?", "According to Albert Einstein, time is relative to perspective. Thus, so is distance, because it takes time to travel a distance. Relativity does not imply that interstellar travel is impossible, just mind-meltingly difficult. You can get into a great star ship and fly very, very fast. By doing so, time passes by very slowly for you compared to the places you are passing. You will be able to reach another star handily if you fly fast enough. The hitch is that you have to be prepared to say goodbye to everything you know. Your entire race may have died out in the five years you were \"on the road,\" because the clock back home wasn't slowed down like yours was. There is the theory of Miguel Alcubierre about the Alcubierre drive, which doesn't conflict with Einstein's theory of relativity and does allow faster-than-light travel. There are some recent documentaries on it. The popular TV series \"Star Trek\" used such theory to allow for faster than light travel. The warp drive in Enterprise is an example of the Alcubierre drive used in science fiction. It is not the speed that makes Matthew McConaughey and Anne Hathaway age much slower than people on Earth (or on their space ship). It is gravity. Both speed and gravity influence the passing of time (time slows down as they increase). Because of their proximity to the Gargantua black hole, gravity was sufficiently large to make their local time slow down so that minutes equaled years on Earth. Earth's gravity slows time in our everyday life too, but at a much smaller scale."], ["How is Miller's planet so close to the black hole and experiences time relativity, yet doesn't get sucked into it? Isn't this scientifically incorrect?", "Any mass can have a stable orbit around a black hole, where the mass is in free fall towards the black hole but its high lateral velocity keeps it curving around. It is only when an orbit decays and an object crosses the event horizon that it is then conjectured to be consumed by the black hole. Since black holes themselves are invisible, the main way astronomers discover them are by observing large objects like stars orbiting invisible phenomena. Also in the film, the only visible part of the black hole assembly is the accretion disk outside of it producing light much like a star does through fusion. Because this disk is outside the event horizon the light it produces is visible rather than being sucked in. The black hole itself is merely a condensed black sphere devoid of any visible qualities save for the effects its gravitational field has on the matter and energy around it (provided that matter and energy is outside the event horizon) . Although its gravitational field is many times stronger than other large objects, it can be orbited stably by another object just like the sun or any other object with a sufficient gravitational field. Again as mentioned before this has been observed and is in fact our main way of detecting black holes."], ["How did Brand land on Edmunds' planet if the two rangers are detached from the Endurance during the escape from the black hole?", "TARS detaches in one of the two Landers, not a Ranger.

The NASA team believes that the beings may be unable (or unwilling) to communicate directly with humans, specifically that \"They\" are fifth-dimensional, having transcended our four-dimensional ways of understanding the universe. Brand thinks \"They\" have laid out a series of rudimentary breadcrumbs (binary messages) and advanced technology (the wormhole) for humans to follow in order to save ourselves from annihilation. While inside the black hole, the notion arises that \"They\" are humans from the future with much more advanced capabilities than currently possible, and are able to construct the tesseract to allow Cooper to communicate with his daughter due to the strange time properties of where they are."], ["If \"They\" really are future humans, how did they survive in the first place to then help humanity of the past?", "Ostensibly, if \"They\" are \"future humans\" and provide help to the \"present humans\", the \"present humans\" survive into the future to become \"They\", who then provide help to the past. This is known as an ontological, temporal, or \"bootstrap\" paradox. On a linear timeline, it is impossible: if \"present humans\" can't survive without the \"future humans\", the \"present humans\" would die and thus there would be no \"future humans\" to save them. However, in a non-linear or cyclical timeline, this would theoretically be possible since there is no true beginning or end to the timeline. It is also possible that the \"present humans\" do survive to become the \"future humans\" without outside help, but the outcome is more detrimental to the human race, and the \"future humans\" are attempting to help the \"present humans\" to alter the timeline in favor of a better solution - one that they never initially had.\n\nAnother interpretation: Murphys Law: anything that can happen, will happen. This may be an indication towards the quantum mechanics theory of many worlds. This simply means that our daily actions, our free will, creates multiple realities, multiple branches of existence, many worlds, multiverses. You could for instance be served tea and coffee, and elect with your free will to choose coffee; however, in an alternate branch, you pick tea. This creates two realities or branches. Hence, every action, every invocation of our free will leads to a creation of new a branch of parallel existence, leading to possibly infinite branching like a fractal.\n\nThis choice making ability, this free will, which creates multiple branches of reality, can be illustrated as follows: http://rosettacode.org/mw/images/a/a3/Fractal_tree_bbc.gif In one branch, humanity suffers blight, the Earth is dying and extinction looms. In another branch, humanity has progressed, evolved and transcended above space and time. The transcended humanity, or referred to as \"they\", are able to traverse time as a physical dimension. Like normal humanity, \"they\" are able to travel through space backwards and forwards, and in all other directions. However, the difference is that \"they\" can also travel to events in time whether backwards or forwards. This time-travel is not a literal one whereby previous events can be altered creating paradoxes. Rather, all events which can happen, have happened. Murphys Law from this perspective has happened, not will happen. All possible potential branches of reality have occurred. All events across space and time as observable by \"they\" have already occurred, and are available for \"they\" to traverse; \"they\" are able to observe all branches. Since all possible events or outcomes, or branches of humanity are available for \"they\" to traverse, this implies that branching is in fact finite and not infinite. Therefore, normal humanity experiences limited free will as opposed to unlimited free will; i.e. choices are limited even though a certain route branches to transcending space and time. Since the branching of humanity and creation of many worlds is limited and finite, and since blight is threatening to destroy an entire branch of creation, \"they\", decide to rescue normal humanity to ensure the continued branching of many worlds.\n\nWhy would \"they\" want to create branching / many worlds? Well, \"they\" are humanity which stemmed from normal humanity in the first place from an earlier branch. Perhaps love is the one thing that transcends space and time and \"they\" desire to love? Perhaps \"they\" feel being alone and one is lonely perhaps the 'one' requires the 'many' to express love? Many and one have several themes: many worlds via quantum mechanics, many outcomes explained by Murphys Law, and quite literally many worlds visited; i.e. Miller/Mann/Edmunds. Nature is created and manifested in fractal branching patterns (http://www.miqel.com/fractals_math_patterns/visual-math-natural-fractals.html), by ill-executed actions of limited free will, normal humanity threatens destruction of a fractal branch which \"they\" decide to restore? More evolved, \"they\" have transcended time. If time is transcended, free will cannot exist. If time is a physical dimension which allows \"they\" to navigate to all events past, present and future; this presupposes all events have already occurred and \"they\" simply move from event-to-event, from one point in time to another. Everything that can happen, has happened. Therefore, \"they\", even though evolved, no longer have free will to create further events, thereby are no longer able to create further branches of realities.\n\nHence, the fractal branching stops for \"they\" due to no free will, and the fractal branching in another route is also stopping due to blight. Perhaps, this is another motivation for \"they\" to rescue normal humanity to ensure continued evolution? But, if \"they\" have no free will, how are \"they\" able to create a rescue event? The rescue event is created by \"they\" in normal humanity's branch of existence; i.e. placing of wormhole nearby Saturn, and a tesseract nearby/within Gargantua. Normal humanity then devises and pursues plans A and B. The tesseract placed in the bulk of normal humanity's space-time allows Cooper, via gravitational messaging, to interact with normal humanity's space-time. This interaction is expressed additionally with time as physical dimension on top of normal humanity's branch so that Cooper is able to traverse and message normal humanity's space-time events. Continued evolution may be a theme: \"Mankind was born on Earth, it wasn't meant to die here\" / \"We're explorers, not caretakers\" / etc. \"Our destiny lies above us\" may also elude to predestination, hence themes of free will."], ["Why did \"They\" make the wormhole lead to a planetary system orbiting a black hole?

Specifically, all information exchanged between different time frames has a definite, observational source: NASA coordinates are provided by TARS, singularity data is observed and provided by TARS again.

Our current science describes the universe from an objective perspective, but we all experience the universe from unique, individual, subjective perspectives. Currently we don't know nearly enough to explain what gives rise to this subjectivity. Just as _Interstellar_ (qv) deals with the limits of our understanding of black holes, wormholes, and the like, it seems to speculate on the possibility of real, \"quantifiable\" forces at the heart of human subjectivity. It asks the question: what if our true selves, the source of our subjective experience, exists in and affects areas outside of our current understanding of space and time? Ultimately of course the film cannot answer this question, but Cooper believes, and coincidences of plot - such as Edumund's planet being the correct spot for colonization as believed by Dr. Brand - seem to imply, that \"love\" may be one example of such capacities."], ["In what film formats was _Interstellar_ (qv) available when it was shown in theaters?", "_Interstellar_ (qv) was displayed in a wide range of different types of theaters (i.e formats) including IMAX 70mm film, standard 70mm film, 35mm film, IMAX digital, 4K Digital, and standard digital. In addition, theaters screening _Interstellar_ (qv) on film opened two days prior to their digital counterparts. This caused people who were not film-tech-literate to ask what the difference between the formats are, and which theater format was the \"best\" to see the movie in. Below is a list explaining the difference between each format in layman's terms. For a more detailed explanation as well as a listing of where to find these specialized format theaters click here.\n\nIMAX 70mm: Going to a IMAX 70mm theatre was the optimal way to see _Interstellar_ (qv). The movie was shot using IMAX 70mm film cameras, which are the highest resolution cameras yet devised. As such, when shown in an 70mm IMAX theatre, the sequences shot on IMAX were shown in their highest possible quality, ten times the resolution of standard projection formats, and fill the giant IMAX screens from top to bottom (as opposed to films not shot in IMAX which have black bars on the top and bottom of the screen). _Interstellar_ (qv) opened two days early in IMAX 70mm in approximately 50 theaters across the United States\n\nStandard 70mm film: A standard 70mm film theater offers an image with three times the resolution of standard projection formats. Though a 70mm theater is wide, it is not as high as a IMAX screen, and, as such, scenes of the film shot using IMAX cameras have been cropped at the top and bottom to fill the wide screen. _Interstellar_ (qv) opened two days early in standard 70mm in approximately ten theaters across the United States.\n\nIMAX Digital: IMAX digital has a picture quality that is higher than a standard theater, but lower than IMAX or 70mm. While most IMAX digital screens (those in cineplexes) are not anywhere near as large as a true 70mm IMAX screen, they are larger than a conventional theater. Therefore, when presented on digital IMAX, the sequences shot on IMAX cameras will fill the digital IMAX screens from top to bottom. However, this is not as high as a 70mm IMAX theater (an aspect ratio of up to 1.9:1. as opposed to 1.44:1). Some original (purpose-built) IMAX theaters have been converted to 4K digital projection; these combine the resolution of IMAX Digital with the aspect ratio of IMAX 70mm.\n\n35mm Film: As 35mm is shown on standard theater screens, it is not as high as a IMAX screen. As such, the scenes of the film shot using IMAX cameras have been cropped at the top and bottom to fill the wide screen. However, many scenes of _Interstellar_ (qv) were shot using 35mm film cameras. Seeing the film in that format will be preserving all the rich analog color and high resolution of the original 35mm photography. _Interstellar_ (qv) will open two days early in 35mm film in approximately 189 theaters across the United States.\n\n4K Digital: As 4K digital is shown on standard theater screens, it is not as high as a IMAX screen. As such, the scenes of the film shot using IMAX cameras have been cropped at the top and bottom to fill the wide screen. 4K digital projection produces a clear, bright, high-resolution image with absolute stability and cleanliness.\n\nStandard Digital (2k DCP): As Standard Digital is shown on a standard theater screen, it is not as high as a IMAX screen. As such, scenes of the film shot using IMAX cameras have been cropped at the top and bottom to fill the wide screen. Standard digital is a quarter of the resolution of 4K digital.\n\nFurther Information: Here."], ["Why couldn't NASA just send the robots to scout out the planets?", "As stated by Dr. Mann, despite their intelligence and physical capabilities, robots such as TARS and CASE do not have the ability to adapt and improvise in unexpected situations. For example, when Mann blows the airlock of the Endurance and Cooper attempts to dock, CASE warns him that it is impossible, yet Cooper manages to dock anyway. TARS likely wouldn't have attempted such a risky maneuver because he doesn't have a human's capacity for risk-taking that Cooper does. Another example is on Miller's Planet when the Ranger is hit by a wave and the engine is waterlogged. CASE simply wished to remain on the Ranger until the engines dried out on their own. However, Cooper sparked the engine with oxygen to start it quickly, which allowed them to escape. Had CASE or TARS been the one in command in both circumstances, it is likely that they would not have tried to dock on the Endurance or start the engines on Miller's planet, which would ultimately have led to the failure of the mission."], ["Wouldn't the accretion disk around Gargantua kill Cooper and Brand with radiation?", "An accretion disk's light is caused by friction, which in turn is caused by the spinning of the gas and dust orbiting a black hole. The faster the disk spins, the more friction, and thus more energy, is created. This energy radiates in the form of electromagnetic radiation (UV rays, X rays, etc) and heat. The faster the black hole spins, the more is formed. According to Kip Thorne's book, \"The Science of _Interstellar_ (qv)\", due to Gargantua's massive size, the accretion disk only spins fast enough to form limited amounts of heat, and thus only produces small amounts of electromagnetic radiation (Roughly on a solar level). The accretion disk does not actually \"bend over\" the black hole, that is simply an illusion caused by the bending of light due to Gargantua's gravity. Thus, if the Endurance remained a sufficient distance from the disk, it would be unscathed."], ["When is _Interstellar_ (qv) set?", "It's never specified in the movie, but there are many hints.

For example, the lobby and the Colorado Lounge (where Jack sets up his typewriter) were based on the Ahwahnee Hotel in Yosemite National Park. The Gold Room (where the July 4th ball takes place) and red bathroom were inspired by the Biltmore Hotel in Phoenix, Arizona, which was designed by famed architect Frank Lloyd Wright. For the establishing shots of the hotel at the end of the title sequence, the Timberline Lodge on Mt. Hood in Oregon was used."], ["What was the idea behind the title sequence?", "According to Kubrick, the sequence was an attempt \"to establish an ominous mood during Jack's first drive up to the hotel - the vast isolation and eerie splendor of high mountains, and the narrow, winding roads which would become impassable after heavy snow\" (quoted here). Kubrick's biographer, 'John Baxter' (qv), argues on his DVD commentary, that the sequence tells the viewer exactly what type of story this is going to be; \"a story of a single weak human being moving into a world where he simply is not going to be able to handle what faces him. A single man going into something he can't handle.\" Essentially, the sequence sets up the story and the mood of that story; it establishes the senses of isolation and remoteness, and it explains to the viewer, wholly through images, that into this isolation and remoteness is headed a single man who is going to prove insignificant in the face of what he finds there, and incapable of resisting it."], ["Why isn't the hedge maze visible in the exterior shots of the hotel at the end of the title sequence?", "This is because for the establishing shots of the hotel at the end of the title sequence, the real-life Timberline Lodge was used. No such maze exists at the Timberline, hence it can't be seen in these shots. For the scenes at ground level where the maze and the hotel can be seen in the same shot (such as when Ullman is showing Jack and Wendy around the grounds), the exterior of the hotel was a fa\u00e7ade built next to the maze on location near Elstree Studios, where the interiors were shot; hence the continuity error of the maze being in some exterior shots and not in others."], ["Who is Tony?", "In the book, Tony is the man Danny would eventually grow up to be, sending messages back from the future to help guide his younger self. In the film, Tony is simply an imaginary friend; as Danny himself describes him, \"the little boy who lives inside my mouth.\" According to Kubrick,  Danny has had a frightening and disturbing childhood. Brutalized by his father and haunted by his paranormal visions, he has had to find some psychological mechanism within himself to manage these powerful and dangerous forces. To do this, he creates his imaginary friend, Tony, through whom Danny can rationalize his visions and survive (quoted here)."], ["Who were the Donner Party?", "During the Torrances' drive to the Overlook Hotel, Wendy asks Jack if they are anywhere near where the Donner Party were stranded, to which he replies they aren't. When Danny enquires as to who the Donner Party were, Jack tells him that they were travelers who were stranded in the mountains one winter, and who had to resort to cannibalism in order to survive. This is a reference to a real life incident which occurred in the Sierra-Nevada mountain range in the winter of 1846-1847. The Donner Party was composed of George Donner, his brother Jacob Donner, and James F. Reed, along with their families and hired hands, totaling 87 people in all. Heading for California, they had left Springfield Illinois in April, but upon reaching the Sierra Nevada at the end of October, a snowstorm blocked their way. Demoralized and low on supplies, about 60 travelers camped at a lake (now called Donner Lake), whilst the rest camped at Alder Creek, about six miles away. They soon found themselves having to slaughter their oxen for food, and by mid-December they discovered that they were running dangerously low on edible material. As such, fifteen of them set out on foot for Sutter's Fort, about 100 miles away, although one man turned back early on. The remaining fourteen quickly became lost, and ran out of food. Caught without shelter in a blizzard, four of them died, and the survivors resorted to cannibalism to stay alive, then continued on their journey. En route, three more died and they too were cannibalized. The seven survivors reached safety on January 18, 1847. At Sutter's Fort, four rescue parties were organized for those who remained behind in the mountains. When the first rescue party arrived on February 18, they found that fourteen of the party had died and the rest were extremely weak. They had been eating boiled ox hide, and up to that point, there had been no cannibalism. The rescue party set out with twenty-one refugees on February 22. When the second rescue party arrived a week later, on February 29, there had been no more deaths, but 31 of those left behind had begun to eat the dead. The rescuers took 17 with them, leaving 14 alive at the camps. When the third rescue party arrived on March 13, they found nine people still alive. They rescued four children, but had to leave the other five people behind. By the time the fourth party reached the camps on April 17, only one man was left alive, and he was safely returned to the Fort. He too had resorted to cannibalism. In all, of the original 87 pioneers, 39 died and 48 survived. See here for a detailed timeline of the events; here for much factual information; and here for a professional historian's analysis of the importance and lasting legacy of the incident."], ["Who are the two girls Danny sees several times?", "They are Grady's daughters, who were murdered during their father's tenure as the hotel caretaker."], ["Is there any significance in the references to Native Americans?", "References to Native Americans and their culture are dotted throughout the film. For example, Stuart Ullman points out that the hotel is built on the site of an ancient Indian burial ground; Indian motifs and designs decorate the walls of the interior of the hotel; Calumet baking powder cans feature prominently in two pivotal scenes (as Hallorann first shines, asking Danny if he wants some ice-cream, and as Jack asks Grady to let him out of the locked pantry); July 4th is given great significance at the end of the film. These references to Native American culture and history are unique to the film, they are not found in the book, and this has prompted many fans over the years to query their importance. On July 29, 1987 'Bill Blakemore' (qv) published a short article in the San Francisco Chronicle entitled \"The Family of Man,\" in which he attempted to attribute specific meaning to the Native American references found in the film. Blakemore argued that _The Shining_ (qv) is not so much about one man's murderous rampage in an effort to destroy his family, as it is about the murderous rampage of the white man in an effort to destroy the Native American race. In his introductory paragraph, Blakemore very clearly states,  _The Shining_ (qv) is not really about the murders at the Overlook Hotel. It is about the murder of a race -- the race of Native Americans -- and the consequences of that murder [...] it is also explicitly about America's general inability to admit to the gravity of the genocide of the Indians -- or, more exactly, its ability to \"overlook\" that genocide. Blakemore takes a predominantly metaphorical approach to the film, arguing that hidden meaning is to be found beneath the surface, and that that hidden meaning, when discovered in an individual scene or character, can then be applied to the film as a whole. For example, he finds the scene immediately after Jack kills Hallorann as particularly significant in a metaphorical sense. Blakemore argues that the long shot showing the grinning Jack standing over Hallorann's bleeding body, which is lying across a rug decorated with an Indian motif, is a metaphor for the violence perpetrated by white people over black people and Indians in America.\n\nBlakemore works to connect different aspects of the film which may not initially seem connected at all. For example, he argues that the reference to Indian burial ground and the river of blood flowing from the elevator are intimately tied together;  the first and most frequently seen of the film's very real American \"ghosts\" is the flooding river of blood that wells out of the elevator shaft, which presumably sinks into the Indian burial ground itself. The blood squeezes out in spite of the fact that the red doors are kept firmly shut within their surrounding Indian artwork embellished frames. We never hear the rushing blood. It is a mute nightmare. It is the blood upon which this nation, like most nations, was built, as was the Overlook Hotel.\n Like most viewers, Blakemore also finds the final shot to be greatly significant, and it too contains hidden meaning which informs the film's protest against the violence perpetrated against Native Americans;  the master key to unlocking the whole movie, is that most Americans overlook the fact that July Fourth was no ball, nor any kind of Independence day, for Native Americans; that the weak American villain of the film is the re-embodiment of the American men who massacred the Indians in earlier years; that Kubrick is examining and reflecting on a problem that cuts through the decades and centuries.\n Blakemore concludes his article by extending his argument even further, saying, although Kubrick is protesting against the specific violence experienced by Native Americans, he is also protesting against the general violence experienced by all mankind; \"though [Kubrick] has made here a movie about the arrival of Old World evils in America, he is exploring most specifically an old question: Why do humans constantly perpetuate such \"inhumanity\" against humans? That family is the family of man.\" Reaction to Blakemore's article has been mixed over the years, although some critics have latched onto his hypothesis and ran with it. For example, Ari Kahan of the Alt.Movies.Kubrick FAQ is in total agreement with Blakemore. Kahan argues that  The Overlook Hotel is America. America, like the Overlook, is built on an Indian graveyard. The blood of the buried Indians seeping up through the elevator shafts is silent. So are the Indian tapestries that Danny rides over on his bigwheel. _The Shining_ (qv) is Kubrick's observation that America is built on hypocrisy, on a failure -- a refusal -- to acknowledge the violence from which it is born. That violence remains silent today because we refuse to look in the mirror - where all the ugly truths appear: Redrum spelled correctly; Jack's old crone, etc. [...] July 4 marks the commemoration of the ugliness on which this country is built: it is the demarcation of the annihilation of the aboriginal people, and the formal establishment of the new society. Americans \"overlook\" the bloodshed upon which our society is founded: the British (Grady) heritage of violent colonialism, carried forward by American (Jack) colonizers (quoted here). Blakemore's article can be read in its entirety here."], ["Why was the most haunted room changed from 217 to 237?", "The hotel room in the novel which Danny enters and which contains the dead woman was 217, but the movie changed the number to 237. The filmmakers stated that the hotel used for the exterior shots, the Timberline, did not want the number 217 used, as they actually had a room 217 and did not want guests to be averse to booking it after the film was released. They did not, however, have a room 237.\n\nThe documentary film Room 237, which advances numerous theories involving hidden meanings within the film, makes the claim that the official explanation is untrue, stating that the Timberline did not have a room 217, either, and that therefore the change must be for some other reason. However, the Timberline itself disputes this, stating that they do indeed have a room 217, and that guests often request to book room 237, suggesting that the change of number might actually have been a detriment to business rather than serving its originally intended purpose."], ["Who is the old woman in room 237 and what is her significance?", "Like several other aspects in the story, this is explained in the book but is left far more ambiguous in the film.\n\nIn the book, the woman's name is Mrs. Massey. She came to the Overlook Hotel to conduct an affair with a much younger man; every night, she would get very drunk at the bar, and the two would go back to the room (room 217 in the novel) to have sex. After several days, the young man came down while Mrs. Massey was passed out and took off with the Porsche in which they'd arrived. He didn't return. The following evening, Mrs. Massey got into the bathtub in her room and killed herself by taking thirty sleeping pills washed down with liquor. After her body was discovered, Mr. Massey flew in from New York and threatened to sue Stuart Ullman. However, after realizing what a scandal it would cause both of them, Ullman and Massey covered up the incident by bribing the coroner to change the cause of death from suicide by overdose to heart attack. Afterwards, anyone with the shining ability was able to see Mrs. Massey in the bathtub of the room.\n\nIn the movie, this entire subplot is excluded, yet the old woman ('Billie Gibson' (qv)) in the bathtub is present, albeit with little or no explanation for who she is or why she is there. The most obvious explanation in the context of the film is that room 237 is merely a haunted room where an old lady died and, when Danny entered the room, the old lady tried to strangle him. However, when Jack goes into the room, instead of seeing an old lady, he sees a beautiful young woman ('Lia Beldam' (qv)) in the tub. Only after he begins kissing her does he look into the mirror and realize that she has turned into the old woman, who subsequently chases him from the room. This discrepancy (between Danny's experience and Jack's experience) is sometimes interpreted as Jack's complete embracing of the evil in the hotel, choosing it over his family; metaphorically represented by the fact that he has no qualms about committing adultery with this woman. Once he has embraced the evil, it shows its true form, as it no longer needs to seduce him; i.e. it no longer needs to appear attractive to him, hence it shows itself for what it truly is (in this case, a hideous old woman). Another theory is that the woman is Grady's wife, whom he murdered along with his two daughters. Grady's murder of his family is the only instance of murder which occurred in the hotel (at least as far as we know), and prior to Jack's entry to room 237, the only ghosts seen up to that point are the Grady daughters. Stuart Ullman mentions that Grady stacked the bodies in an unspecified room, and then shot himself; this room could theoretically be room 237, hence the reason why both Danny and Hallorann sense something troubling emanating from that room. A third theory is provided by film critic 'Jonathan Romney' (qv), who argues that perhaps the scene doesn't take place at all;  Whether or not Danny's telepathy brings the Overlook's specters to life, what's certain is that the boy is actually able to transmit them. The film's big horror routine - Jack's encounter in Room 237 with an etiolated vamp turned suppurating hag - might not really be happening at all (Jack subsequently tells Wendy he's seen nothing in the room), but may in its entirety be a hyperimaginative boy's visual metaphor for the urgency of events. There's a stark difference between the shots of Danny wide-eyed in shock elsewhere in the film and the images of him here, in a dribbling trance, not so much transfixed as in a state of extreme concentration, as if he's at once composing the images and sending them. Filmmaker 'Paul Mayersberg' (qv) provides still another view:  It would be wrong to insist on a single interpretation of this scene, but in looking at it, it exposes the heart of Kubrick's method in the film. First, it is a rewrite of the shower scene in _Psycho_ (qv). In _Psycho_ (qv) it is the lady in the shower who is threatened by the monster outside. In _The Shining_ (qv) this is reversed. Jack is the 'monster', scared by what might emerge from the shower behind the curtain. This reversal of well-known horror conventions is one of many in the film. Underlying many sequences in _The Shining_ (qv) is a critique of the whole genre of horror movies. The character of Jack Torrance himself is presented as the innocent, not knowing what he is getting himself into, whereas he is in fact the threatening element. Secondly, the woman turning from slim youth to grotesque age is perhaps symbolic of everyone's most feared destiny, growing old. To watch your own body over a period of years disintegrate before the mirror is an essential horror story for all of us. Fear of old age grips Jack Torrance by the throat as does fear of losing his mind. Growing old and losing your senses, time passing, is a frightening notion that is inescapable. Thirdly, it is the only overtly sexual scene in the movie. _The Shining_ (qv) is a strangely chaste horror story. Part of this comes from Jack's sexual indifference; he is always glancing at women, including his wife, but he never actually does anything to them. Lack of sexual drive is characteristic of a paranoid personality. The young naked woman also seems asexual. She looks like one of those models who pose in seedy lunchtime photographic clubs. Fourthly, the marks on the old woman's body, which so repel Jack, are difficult to identify. When she rises out of the bath in a shot that seems to refer to 'Henri-Georges Clouzot' (qv)'s _Les diaboliques_ (qv), she seems diseased. Then the marks look as if they had been applied like paint. There is also a hint that this woman has come from another world or an earlier civilization. All these interpretations have a certain validity without getting near totally to describing the scene (quoted here)."], ["If Hallorann told Danny that the ghosts were not dangerous, how did the woman in room 237 strangle him?", "It isn't explained in the film but, in the book, it's mentioned that Danny's psychic abilities give the malevolent spirits of the Overlook a stronger power and that they feed on the strength of his psychic energy. Thus, the woman in room 237 becomes more powerful and is able to physically attack Danny. Also, Hallorann may have said the ghosts weren't dangerous because, for the most part, they're not, or possibly because they had never been dangerous in his personal experience. However, when Danny asks about room 237 and whether Hallorann was scared of that room, Hallorann's cheerful demeanor quickly changes to serious and direct. Hallorann says to Danny \"No I'm not [afraid of room 237]....there ain't nothin' in there. But you don't got no business going in there anyhow, so stay *out* of room 237 you understand? Stay *out*!\". So it's possible that this particular room is the root of the evil in the hotel and, if disturbed, can release more powerful entities that are able to physically harm the guests."], ["What is \"White Man's Burden?\"", "During his first conversation with Lloyd ('Joe Turkel' (qv)), Jack asks for a drink and then says, \"You set 'em up and I'll knock 'em back Lloyd, one b'one. White man's burden, Lloyd my man. White man's burden.\" There are several viable interpretations of Jack's use of the phrase. Firstly, In the context of the scene, Jack could be referring simply to alcoholism and, as a former school teacher, he is making an ironic reference to Rudyard Kipling's 1899 poem \"The White Man's Burden\". It's possible that he is, quite simply, referring to the alcohol itself, calling it a burden in an ironic sense because he enjoys it so much, and referring to it as 'White Man's' insofar as the white man introduced alcohol into the Americas, hence they now have the 'burden' of drinking it. As such, he is, in effect, saying \"Give me a drink, such is my burden.\" There is another, more politically derived interpretation however, which may suggest an allusion to the European colonization of North America and the effect that colonization had on Native Americans. Merriam-Webster Online defines the phrase 'White Man's Burden' as \"the alleged duty of the white peoples to manage the affairs of the less developed nonwhite peoples.\" The white man's burden was to raise non-white people out of poverty and ignorance through imperialism, whilst at the same time alcohol was turning white men into savages. Some lines from the poem:\n\n\"Take up the White Man's burden--/Send forth the best ye breed--/Go, bind your sons to exile/To serve your captives' need;/On fluttered folk and wild--/Your new-caught sullen peoples,/Half devil and half child.\"\n\n\"Take up the White Man's burden--/The savage wars of peace--/Fill full the mouth of Famine,/And bid the sickness cease;/And when your goal is nearest/(The end for others sought)/Watch sloth and heathen folly/Bring all your hope to nought.\"\n\n\"Take up the White Man's burden!/Have done with childish days--/The lightly-proffered laurel,/The easy ungrudged praise:/Comes now, to search your manhood/Through all the thankless years,/Cold, edged with dear-bought wisdom,/The judgment of your peers.\""], ["How does Hallorann know something is wrong at the Overlook?", "Danny uses his shining ability to send a telepathic message to Hallorann in Florida telling him that all is not well in the hotel. The scene where Hallorann lies on his bed, realizing that something is wrong in the hotel (i.e. him receiving the message), is intercut with a scene of Danny sitting on his own bed, shivering and staring into space (i.e. him sending the message)."], ["Why is Grady referred to by two first names...Charles and Delbert?", "In Jack's interview at the start of the film, Stuart Ullman tells him the story of a former caretaker who got cabin fever, butchered his family with an axe and then shot himself. The man's name was Charles Grady. Later on in the film, Jack meets a butler also called Grady and Jack explains to him that he knows all about the man's murder of his family, as he saw the pictures in the paper and he recognizes him. The problem is that the butler's name is Delbert Grady, not Charles Grady. Some viewers see this as a continuity error while others conclude that it could not possibly exist by accident and, therefore, must have meaning. On one hand, The Kubrick FAQ argues that the name change carries great significance;  The duality of Delbert/Charles Grady deliberately mirrors Jack Torrance being both the husband of Wendy/father of Danny and the mysterious man in the July 4th photo. It is to say he is two people: the man with choice in a perilous situation and the man who has 'always' been at the Overlook. It's a mistake to see the final photo as evidence that the events of the film are predetermined: Jack has any number of moments where he can act other than the way he does, and that his (poor) choices are fueled by weakness and fear perhaps merely speaks all the more to the questions about the personal and the political that _The Shining_ (qv) brings up. In the same way Charles had a chance - once more, perhaps - to not take on Delbert's legacy, so Jack may have had a chance to escape his role as 'caretaker' to the interests of the powerful. It's the tragic course of this story that he chooses not to (quoted here).\n The argument is that Delbert Grady was the butler in the 1920s (as he says himself, he has \"always\" been at the Overlook) and Charles Grady was the caretaker in the 1970s (a man presented with a \"perilous situation,\" just as Jack would be years later), and rather than being two completely different people (or indeed the same person with two names), they are two 'manifestations' of a similar entity; the part permanently at the hotel (Delbert) and the part which is given the choice of whether to join the legacy of the hotel's murderous past (Charles), just as the man in the photo is not the same man who Stuart Ullman hires to be the hotel's caretaker, but nor is he someone entirely different. Jack in the photo has 'always' been at the Overlook, Jack the caretaker chooses to become part of the hotel (if one follows the logic of this argument, the implication is that the person in the July 4th photo would not in fact be called Jack).\n\nThe problem with this argument is that the film itself provides no solid evidence for such a claim - any arguments that the change in name has any significance whatsoever remain wholly speculative. It also fails to address the fact that while Jack appears to learn of the story for the first time from Mr. Ullman, he later tells Grady that he learned of the incident via the newspaper (this may reference a scene from the book, wherein Jack spends an afternoon in the hotel basement reading a collection of clippings detailing the Overlook's history; that theory is supported by the fact that a scrapbook of clippings is indeed visible on Jack's writing desk in one scene, but despite its presence he's never shown reading or otherwise acknowledging it in any cut of the film). The viewer must additionally rationalize why Jack reacts to the name Delbert Grady and assumes this man to be the man initially named to him as Charles (an assumption Grady himself eventually confirms). It's perhaps significant to note that in the novel, the character is always known as Delbert. On the other hand, the film's assistant editor 'Gordon Stainforth' (qv) has commented on this issue, attempting to steer a course between the continuity error explanation on one side and the hidden meaning explanation on the other;  I don't think we'll ever quite unravel this. Was his full name Charles Delbert Grady? Perhaps Charles was a sort of nickname? Perhaps Ullman got the name wrong? But I also think that Stanley did NOT want the whole story to fit together too neatly, so [it is] absolutely correct, I think, to say that 'the sum of what we learn refuses to add up neatly' (quoted here). So, is the name change a continuity error or a hint at a deeper meaning? Stainforth is probably nearest the truth when he says \"I don't think we'll ever quite unravel this.\" There will always be those who will argue there is no way it could be as simple as a continuity error, and there will always be those who will argue that to explain such an obvious continuity error as intrinsically meaningful is absurd. As such, it is ultimately left up to each individual viewer to make up their own mind and reach their own conclusions as regards the ambiguity. The two names for both characters is a transformation/submission into evil. Delbert, as he is first introduced, is a nice polite butler but as the scene and movie go on we can get a sense of his transformation into Charles. The same may be suggested for Jack. While many can argue that Johnny is another name for Jack, as Bill to William for example. It has been said that the line was improved by Nicholson. But as Jack is \"hacking\" into the bathroom with the axe and yells the famous line \"Here's Johnny!\" Jack has completed his transformation into evil and will remain forever in the hotel as Delbert/Charles."], ["Who is the man in the bear costume in \"_The Shining_ (qv)\"?", "One of the most chilling and surprising shots in the movie is the man in the horrible, fat bear suit fellating a gentleman in a tuxedo. The movie doesn't expressly explain the identity of the man, but in the book, 'Stephen King' (qv) provides the  answer. In brief, it references a scene from the book in which the Overlook Hotel's former owner, Horace Derwent, is receiving fellatio from a pining lover Roger, who is dressed in a dog costume. However, Kubrick made some  key changes for specific reasons."], ["Were the ghosts real or did Jack imagine them?", "According to 'Stanley Kubrick' (qv): For the purposes of telling the story, my view is that the paranormal is genuine. Jack's mental state serves only to prepare him for the murder, and to temporarily mislead the audience... As the supernatural events occurred you searched for an explanation, and the most likely one seemed to be that the strange things that were happening would finally be explained as the products of Jack's imagination. It's not until Grady, the ghost of the former caretaker who axed to death his family, slides open the bolt of the larder door, allowing Jack to escape, that you are left with no other explanation but the supernatural (quoted here)."], ["Who opened the pantry door and freed Jack?", "The spirit of Delbert Grady unlocked the door."], ["How does the movie end?", "Danny backtracks in the snow, carefully placing his feet into his own footprints, then hides in the hedges until Jack goes by. Following his own footprints into the maze, Danny makes his way out of the maze and into Wendy's arms. Wendy loads him into Hallorann's Cat, and they drive away, leaving Jack ranting wildly in the maze. The final scene shows Jack frozen in the snow. The camera then pushes in on a display of photos hanging in the Gold Room. One of them, a photo of the July 4th Ball of 1921, features a group of partiers with Jack at the head."], ["What's the significance of the photograph at the end of the film?", "Probably the single most frequently asked question in relation to this film is what does the final shot mean; how and why is Jack in a photograph from 1921? In a film with so much irreconcilable ambiguity, this one shot has generated more puzzlement than the entire rest of the movie, yet it is one part of the film on which 'Stanley Kubrick' (qv) has been extremely clear about his intentions. As he told 'Michel Ciment' (qv), \"The ballroom photograph at the end suggests the reincarnation of Jack\" (quoted here). So, Jack is reincarnated. But what exactly does that mean? Perhaps the simplest explanation for this is that Jack is the reincarnation of a prior hotel guest; the person in the photo is not Jack, but a guest who was present in 1921. Jack is the reincarnation of this guest. This would seem to support Gordon Dahlquist's argument that Delbert Grady and Charles Grady are different people (mentioned above); if we follow the argument through, it would suggest that Charles Grady (the caretaker who killed his family) was the reincarnation of Delbert Grady (the butler in the 1920s). Similarly, Jack (the caretaker who attempts to kill his family) is the reincarnation of the unnamed man in the photograph (the caretaker in the 1920s). This argument would also seem to support Grady's claim to Jack that he has \"always\" been the caretaker; if Jack is the reincarnation of the caretaker from the 1920s, it would suggest that the hotel continuously 'reanimates' its 1921 guests, bringing them back in different guises; hence, just as Delbert was brought back as Charles, so too is the man in the photo brought back as Jack, in a process which, it would seem, is ongoing. As such, when Grady comments that both he and Jack have always been at the hotel, he is correct; they will forever be brought back to the hotel as reincarnations, hence they are 'always' there.\n\nHowever, despite the fact that this argument does seem to take into consideration many of the variables in the film, and does seem to provide a reasonably logical rational for the photograph, it is not the most popular theory about the final shot. Instead, most fans subscribe to the notion that after he dies, Jack is 'absorbed' back through time into the past of the hotel, becoming, for all intents and purposes, a 'part' of the hotel. This explains why he is present in a photograph from 1921; when he dies, the hotel takes hold of his spirit or soul, and traps him within its own history (this argument would seem to suggest that Jack was not in the photo prior to his death). As with the above argument regarding reincarnation, the 'absorption theory' would also account for Grady's \"always\" comment. Presumably, the same thing happened to Grady as we see happening to Jack, he too dies in the Overlook Hotel, and he too is absorbed back into its past. As such, Grady has always been the butler, just as Jack has always been the caretaker insofar as they were both imprisoned in the future by the hotel, and their spirits became anachronistically part of history. A reasonably detailed analysis of the mysterious photo was published in the September 1999 edition of Sight and Sound magazine; an article by 'Jonathan Romney' (qv) entitled \"'Stanley Kubrick' (qv), 1928-1999: Resident Phantoms,\" in which he looks at, amongst other things, the meaning of the film's final shot. Initially, Romney supports the absorption theory, writing  The closing inscription appears to explain what has happened to Jack [...] after his ordeal in the haunted palace, Jack had been absorbed into the hotel, another sacrificial victim earning his place at the Overlook's eternal th\u00e9 dansant of the damned. At the Overlook, it's always 4 July 1921. However, Romney is quick to point out that it may not in fact be this simple;  Or you can look at it another way. Perhaps Jack hasn't been absorbed - perhaps he has really been in the Overlook all along. As the ghostly butler Grady tells him during their chilling con\u00adfrontation in the men's toilet, \"You're the caretaker, sir. You've always been the caretaker.\" Perhaps in some earlier incarnation Jack really was around in 1921, and it's his present-day self that is the shadow, the phantom photographic copy. In this sense then, Romney is acknowledging that the reincarnation theory is just as plausible as the absorption theory. Whatever the case however, whether Jack is a reincarnation of a previous guest or whether he has been absorbed into the history of the hotel, Romney reaches one inescapable conclusion about the final shot; \"Jack's reward, after his defeat [is] a central place among who knows how many other doomed variety acts on the Overlook's wall of fame. He's added to the bill on the Overlook's everlasting big night back in 1921.\" So, irrespective of whether it is reincarnation or whether it is absorption, it would seem that the one thing about the final shot that is certain is that Jack has somehow, in some sense, become part of the hotel, and will remain a part of it forever. Romney's article is available in its entirety (in an archived version) here.\n\nMore information can be found here."], ["I've heard something about a helicopter shadow. To what does it refer?", "In the opening sequence of the film, just prior to the beginning of the credit roll, the shadow of the camera helicopter is clearly visible in the lower right hand corner of the frame. Over the years, this shot has become quite infamous, and has generated a huge amount of debate amongst fans. Generally speaking, there are two prevailing opinions about the shot: (1) It's a goof, plain and simple, and (2) _The Shining_ (qv) was shot \"flat\" (as opposed to using anamorphic lenses) in an aspect ratio of 1.33:1 (known as Academy aperture, or \"full frame\") to be projected at the widescreen ratio of 1.85:1. This is a process known as \"soft matte\" or \"open matte\" which refers to the fact that, for theatrical exhibition, the 1.33:1 image is matted to 1.85:1 - in other words, as described below, the top and bottom of the frame are masked to create a widescreen frame. Unimportant picture information underneath the mattes is never meant to be seen. If _The Shining_ (qv) was projected theatrically incorrectly with the mattes not properly applied, the top and/or bottom of the frame would become visible when they shouldn't, and the helicopter shadow would be revealed. In this case, the shadow is not a goof, it's a projection error; when the film is viewed in its correct 1.85:1 ratio, the shadow is not visible. Proponents of the aspect ratio theory dismiss proponents of the goof theory by saying there is no way such a massive goof could get into a Kubrick film. Proponents of the goof theory dismiss proponents of the aspect ratio theory by saying they are wrong, and the shadow is visible in all formats. Assistant editor 'Gordon Stainforth' (qv) has spoken at length about this issue:  While I did the first cut, it is just possible that 'Ray Lovejoy' (qv) made some alterations to the picture when he was finalizing the front titles and credits - I have a distinct recollection of him asking me for the trims - but I think not. But I do have a recollection that at one stage in the movie some of those cuts were going to be dissolves. It is just possible that when we changed that mix to a straight cut we went back slightly beyond the centre point of the dissolve to get the absolute maximum length out of the shot. Musically and emotionally I remember we needed absolutely every usable frame of that first long shot with the titles. OK, some key facts: Although _The Shining_ (qv) was shot with the full academy aperture, it was designed and composed entirely for the 1.85:1 ratio, and that is the only way it should be projected in the theatre. All the Steenbecks in the cutting rooms accordingly had their screens marked, or even masked off, with the 1.85:1 ratio. The 6-plate Steenbeck in Stanley and Ray's main cutting room was masked off with black masking tape, because you cannot cut a movie properly unless you can see the frame exactly as it will appear in the cinema. However the helicopter shadow IS almost certainly visible for about 4 or 5 frames at the edge of the 1.85:1 masking. But it was NOT visible on any of the correctly marked-up Steenbecks, or in the main viewing theatre at Elstree, at least, not as the first version of the film left Elstree in 1980. I think now that this mistake may have crept in very late during the editing of the movie when the first caption-title 'The Interview' was shortened by 8 frames on 23 April 1980 and the Main Title/credit sequence was lengthened accordingly by 8 frames, since the music could not be shortened (this information is based on my original cutting room notes). Every one of the show prints of the first 6 interpositives for the American release of _The Shining_ (qv) was personally checked in the viewing theatre at Elstree by Stanley himself. IF the helicopter shadow was fleetingly visible, either Stanley did not notice it, or it was so trivial that it did not bother him. Unfortunately the masking and racking in many theatres is incredibly inaccurate. I therefore suspect that people who have seen this \"awful\" shadow for any length of time on the cinema screen must have seen it projected at completely the wrong ratio (probably 1.66:1!), or incredibly badly racked, or both. Or of course they've seen it on the video, where it's visible for just over a second! (quoted here).\n So, the fact is that the shadow is not a goof; it's a quirk of the 1.33:1 aspect ratio in which the film was shot. When viewed at the correct ratio of 1.85:1, the shadow is not visible. You can see the famous 'goof' here; the shadow appears at approximately 01:06 in the lower right corner of the screen and is visible for about one and a half seconds."], ["I've heard mirrors are important in the film. Why is this?", "Whenever Jack sees a ghost, a mirror is always present, e.g., when he meets Lloyd there is a mirror behind the bartender, when he speaks with Grady there is a long mirror beside them, and when he encounters the woman in room 237 there is a full length mirror in front of him. The only ghost scene that doesn't have a mirror is the one where he can't actually see the ghost (when Grady speaks to him from outside the pantry). Some viewers have argued that this indicates that the ghosts are not real at all and that Jack is essentially talking to himself by projecting another figure into the mirror. However, there are no mirrors present when Danny sees the Grady sisters or when Wendy begins to encounter ghosts towards the end of the film. As director Kubrick intended that the ghosts in the film be seen as real, the presence of mirrors in the scenes of Jack's encounters, while it may offer food for viewer discussion, does not provide a strong argument for the stance of the ghosts being not real."], ["Are the continuity errors in the film simply mistakes or is there some other explanation for them?", "Of all the issues which have provoked debate over the years regarding this film, the issue of continuity errors is perhaps the most hotly debated topic of them all. This argument has come about because the film does contain what appear to be, on the surface at least, some glaring continuity errors. However, some fans have argued that there is no way such continuity errors could have occurred by mistake in a Kubrick film, and therefore, such errors are not errors at all, but subtle pointers to the audience consciously inserted by Kubrick into the film to hint at a deeper meaning below the surface (for example, Grady's name changing from Charles to Delbert midway through the film has been argued to signify that there were in fact two separate manifestations of the character). Others, however, dismiss this as completely preposterous, arguing that such errors are simply that, errors, and any attempt to rationalize them as having meaning and being deliberate on Kubrick's part is absurd. Here is a list of some of the major continuity errors in the film, including theories which 'explain' them\n\nThe position of the freezer doors changes: As he shows them around the kitchen, Hallorann tells Wendy and Danny that they have arrived at the walk-in freezer. He turns his head away from the camera and opens the freezer door on the left side of the frame. However, when we cut to a shot inside the freezer as the door opens, Hallorann is holding the door with his other hand and the door itself is opening in the opposite direction. Additionally, when they leave the freezer, the door is on the opposite wall from where they entered.\n\nRationale: This is part of the film's attempt to disorientate and confuse the viewer so as to make the hotel seem more threatening and mysterious, as if suggesting that the hotel itself is quite literally protean, and capable of shifting in physical space (apparently without any of the characters in the hotel noticing).\n\nDanny's hands in relation to the ice cream bowl: During Hallorann's conversation with Danny about shining, Danny's hands appear in front of the ice cream bowl in some shots, and behind in it other shots, jumping back and forth throughout the scene.\n\nRationale: This has also been suggested to be a disorientating technique, making the viewer uneasy and putting them on edge as even banal things are made to seem unstable.\n\nThe Maze: The maze itself, the diagram of the maze on the sign at the entrance, and the 3D model of the maze in the Colorado Lounge all look completely different.\n\nRationale: The maze is not fixed; it is a metaphor for all mazes, both literal and psychological. It is not so much an actual maze as a symbol for the confusion and disorientation one feels within the maze of ones mind.\n\nTapestries and Pictures: On the walls around the corridors are many rugs, tapestries and pictures. Throughout the course of the film, they often switch places or are hung upside-down.\n\nRationale: More disorientation of the viewer; possibly also the hotel manipulating physical space to disorientate the characters.\n\nJack's typewriter changes color: In the early parts of the film, Jack has a white typewriter, but during the \"Get the fuck out of here\" conversation with Wendy, the typewriter is blue, and it remains blue for the rest of the film.\n\nRationale: 'Bill Blakemore' (qv) argues that the change in color is part of the film's metaphorical examination of the genocide of Native Americans. He argues that the shift from white to blue is a reference to the American flag, with the red of the flag being provided by the bleeding elevator (which is the blood of the Indians buried under the hotel).\n\nPaper appears in Jack's typewriter without him inserting it: At the start of the \"Get the fuck out of here\" conversation with Wendy, Jack removes the sheet of paper in his typewriter, so as Wendy cannot see what he is working on. After she walks away, a fresh sheet of paper mysteriously appears in the typewriter, without Jack having had the time to put it in himself .\n\nRationale: The hotel itself is quite literally supplying Jack with paper so as to hasten the onset of his madness. However, that this is a simple continuity error has been suggested by assistant editor 'Gordon Stainforth' (qv); \"In the process of editing a long scene, when the action gets greatly compressed, so-called 'continuity errors' are almost bound to occur. A good examples of this is the piece of paper in Jack's typewriter in the early \"why don't you get the fuck out of here\" scene. In the full version of the scene, I am certain that Jack reloaded the typewriter just before continuing his typing\" (quoted here). In this sense then, the shot of him replacing the paper himself was simply removed so as to compress time, hence creating a simple continuity error.\n\nWendy holding Jack: After Jack has fallen from his chair after his nightmare, Wendy's hands are on different places on Jack's body in different shots (sometimes his arms, sometimes his knees, sometimes his shoulder) and sometimes not on him at all.\n\nRationale: The scene was structured this way to show Jack's irrationality, and Wendy's inability to comfort him; as represented by the fact that she keeps changing where her hands are, she cannot find the 'right' spot, indicating that whatever love they may once have shared is long since gone. It is also worth noting that Wendy's hand makes a \"retreat\" between shots as the scene progresses (from his far knee to his near knee to herself, etc.), perhaps indicating her increasing nervousness and repulsion as he tells her about his nightmare.\n\nThe time since Danny's injury: Early in the film, Wendy tells the doctor Jack hurt Danny six months earlier. Later, when Jack is talking to Lloyd the bartender, he refers to \"six miserable months on the wagon\" (although by that time it should have been seven). However, only moments later, he states that the incident took place three years previously.\n\nRationale: A character error to show Jack is losing all conception of time.\n\nThe old woman in 237: The woman that we see rising from the tub has short white hair, whilst the one Jack is kissing has long brown hair.\n\nRationale: More disorientation for the viewer; the woman is not supposed to be taken literally as 'a woman' but as a symbol of evil, hence continuity issues don't apply.\n\nWendy pulling Jack into the pantry: In the angle from the floor as Wendy drags Jack into the pantry, Jack's arms and hands can clearly be seen going through the door, but then we cut to a shot of Jack trying to grip onto the sides of the door as his arms and hands are dragged through the doorway for the second time.\n\nRationale: This is part of the hotel's ability to play physical tricks with its occupants. We have already seen the pantry 'move' in physical space; this is just another manifestation of that. Stainforth however, points out that this explanation is wrong, and there is an altogether more practical reason for the error: \"This is simply a typical 'overlapped' cut, done an enormous amount in movies. Often time has to be stretched to make a cut work, which is exactly why live video cutting between extremely different camera angles often does NOT work at all well\" (quoted here). As such, this physical manipulation of space by the hotel is quite simply a continuity error created by the editing process.\n\nThe picture on the right side of the lobby: When Jack stands at the end of the lobby, and sees the balloons on the floor, there is a picture on each side of him. When Wendy finds Hallorann's body in the same place however, the picture on the right is gone.\n\nRationale: Another example of the hotel physically manipulating itself to create disorientation in the characters, and by extension, in the viewers.\n\nThe axed door panels: Jack knocks out the right door panel with the axe, then we cut to Hallorann approaching the hotel. We cut back to the door, and now the left panel is also gone, without him having had the time to destroy it.\n\nRationale: The hotel is attempting to aid Jack in getting to his wife by partially removing part of the door itself. Stainforth however points out that in this case, it is a simple continuity error: \"This was simply because of the vast length of the original scene, as shot, and the amount of material that was shot (about 15-20 doors were axed over a period of about three days!) and it was quite impossible to cut a brisk version of it that did not have 'continuity errors'\" (quoted here).\n\nBy way of conclusion to this section, 'Gordon Stainforth' (qv) has commented,  I don't doubt that some of Stanley's 'continuity errors' may [...] have been deliberate. Almost as jests to get the pedants excited e.g. the typewriter changing color [...] Also to create the dream/nightmare ambience of the film (despite its deliberately 'realistic' and well-lit, superficial appearance). Another key point, similar to the continuity one: people have tried to work out the geography/layout of the Overlook Hotel, without success, and without realizing that they have missed the point completely. This is not a real 3D place, but a place which exists in the viewer's imagination. Each person who sees _The Shining_ (qv) builds up their own personal image of the hotel from the disparate fragments they are provided with. The real geography of the hotel does not work, nor was it intended to. It was merely suggested from a composite of images shot on about 10 different stages (quoted here).\n So are they continuity errors or are they indications of a deeper meaning? Stainforth seems to think both are likely - several scenes which have been interpreted as being inherently meaningful he has explained as simple continuity slips, but he also points out that he wouldn't be surprised if Kubrick did indeed insert apparent errors as a hint to his audience that there is a deeper meaning at work (incidentally, James Joyce also employed this technique, particularly in his final novel, Finnegans Wake, where even the title is grammatically incorrect)."], ["How long did the film take to shoot?", "Just over 500 days. As Steadicam operator 'Garrett Brown' (qv) explains on his DVD commentary track, when he was hired to work on the film, he was told it was going to be a five month shoot, maybe six months. He told the producers that it couldn't go over six months as he had to return to America to work on _Rocky II_ (qv) at that time. However, six months into the shoot, less than half the film had been shot. Brown arranged a deal with the producers of _The Shining_ (qv) and the producers of _Rocky II_ (qv) whereby he would work a week on Rocky and then a week on _The Shining_ (qv) travelling by Concorde each Sunday. Brown was able to return to working on _The Shining_ (qv) full time several months later, as although _Rocky II_ (qv) began shooting six months after _The Shining_ (qv), it wrapped two months before Kubrick's movie."], ["Does this film hold the record for the most number of takes in any film?", "This is another hotly debated topic. According to the Guinness Books of Records, the scene of Wendy backing up the stairs as she swings the baseball bat at Jack was shot 127 times, which is a record for the number of retakes of a single scene. However, both assistant editor 'Gordon Stainforth' (qv) and Steadicam operator 'Garrett Brown' (qv) dispute this. According to Stainforth, \"I'm sure Shelley never had to repeat a scene 127 times [...] If my memory is correct it was something in the order of 45 takes\" (quoted here). Similarly, on his DVD commentary, Brown says as far as he remembers, the scene was shot 35 times. However, Brown also claims that the Guinness Book of Records is correct about the film holding the record for the most retakes, it just has the scene and the number wrong. He claims that Kubrick did 148 takes of the scene where Hallorann explains to Danny what shining is; specifically, the over-the-shoulder shot looking at Hallorann himself, meaning actor 'Danny Lloyd' (qv) wasn't forced to do 148 takes, only 'Scatman Crothers' (qv) (it is probably no coincidence that Crothers allegedly broke down emotionally after the umpteenth take of one of his scenes, crying \"What do you want, Mr Kubrick?\"). As such, if we accept that Brown's memory is accurate, then the film does hold the record for the most number of takes of a single scene, but it is for neither the scene nor the number which is usually claimed."], ["Is the film a direct adaptation of the book?", "No, there is a considerable amount of difference between the film and the novel, especially in terms of the psychological presentation of the main characters and the 'motivation' of the evil in the hotel. The multiple changes made to the story by screenwriters 'Stanley Kubrick' (qv) and 'Diane Johnson' (qv) were not without controversy at the time of the film's release, with many fans of the novel accusing Kubrick and Johnson of destroying that which made King's story so compelling in the first place: ignoring, removing or otherwise compromising character traits and plot points which they felt were intrinsic to the whole. However, as Kubrick points out in his interview with 'Michel Ciment' (qv), adapting a 500 page novel into a two hour film is not a straightforward process, and certain aspects of the novel must be left behind or altered for the new medium;  With _The Shining_ (qv), the problem was to extract the essential plot and to re-invent the sections of the story that were weak. The characters needed to be developed a bit differently than they were in the novel. It is in the pruning down phase that the undoing of great novels usually occurs because so much of what is good about them has to do with the fineness of the writing, the insight of the author and often the density of the story [...] Diane and I talked a lot about the book and then we made an outline of the scenes we thought should be included in the film. This list of scenes was shuffled and reshuffled until we thought it was right, and then we began to write. We did several drafts of the screenplay, which was subsequently revised at different stages before and during shooting (the complete transcript of this interview can be found here)."], ["How does the film differ from the novel?", "Perhaps the most obvious, and possibly most important, difference is in the depiction of the protagonist/antagonist, Jack Torrance. In the book, Jack is initially presented as an inherently good man, well-intentioned and protective of his family, but struggling with alcoholism, and battling to overcome his passionate hatred for authority (something which stems from his overly disciplinarian father, who, although he is dead, is still a major factor in Jack's life). Jack is presented as well-meaning, but weak-willed; not an evil man by any means, but a man who can be easily manipulated into doing evil things. Over the course of the novel, he becomes overwhelmed by the forces he encounters in the hotel, and eventually, he becomes totally subservient to them, unable to control his own actions, and carrying out the wishes of the hotel without question as he tries to murder his own wife and son (interestingly, there is a scene towards the end of the novel which many fans argued should have been in the movie as it was a pivotal point of the story in terms of the psychology of Jack: after trapping Wendy and Danny in the hotel, Jack's inherent 'goodness' resurfaces and he helps them escape the building, only to once again succumb to the evil forces surrounding him, and recommence his pursuit). Contrary to the good-natured, genial and well-meaning family man of the novel however, the film's Jack ('Jack Nicholson' (qv)) is established as being irritated by his family from the very start (seen in his exasperation and sense of boredom in the car as they journey to the hotel, and in Wendy's story of how he accidentally dislocated Danny's shoulder). Additionally, his alcoholism is relatively unimportant in his psychological makeup, and his hatred of authority and issues with his father are not mentioned at all.\n\nBecause of the changes made to Jack's character, the character and purpose of Stuart Ullman is also dramatically altered. In the novel, Ullman is extremely despotic, supercilious and condescending. Indeed, he even tells Jack that he personally didn't want him for the job as caretaker, but was overruled by his superiors. This attitude of condescension in turn brings out Jack's issues with authority, and the psychological duel between Jack and Ullman is the primary subject matter of the first few chapters (in fact the opening sentence of the novel is Jack musing about how Ullman is \"an officious little prick\"). In the film however, Ullman ('Barry Nelson' (qv)) is a much more genial character, seemingly genuine in his pleasantness and quite amiable to Jack. As such, he serves little psychological purpose in the filmic narrative, whereas in the novel, his character's raison d'etre is so as the audience can be directly presented with Jack's authority issues. In the film, the character exists primarily to drive forward the plot and fill in some important exposition.\n\nWendy is also considerably different in the novel and the film. In one of the more controversial changes made by Kubrick and Johnson, the Wendy of the film ('Shelley Duvall' (qv)) is a woman of great timidity and passivity, subservient to her husband even when he isn't present, such as in the scene where she nervously defends his breaking of Danny's arm to the aghast doctor ('Anne Jackson' (qv)). In the book, however, Wendy is far more self-reliant and possessed of a much more forceful personality. Her reaction to Jack's madness is also different: in the film, she nearly goes to pieces, becoming hysterical and frightened, acting only out of an instinct to survive and protect her son. While she retains her sanity and overcomes her hysteria long enough to save her son and herself more than once, she is very fragile. In the novel, however, she finds an inner strength and determination in the face of the danger posed by her husband, emerging as an indomitable character with a great resiliency.\n\nAside from playing down Jack's battle with alcoholism and turning Wendy from a strong character into a weak one, the most controversial change from the novel to the film was in relation to the 'purpose' of the forces in the Overlook Hotel; exactly why does the evil send Jack mad, what does it want? In the novel, there is a very straightforward explanation for the hotel's nefarious activities: it wants Danny. If Jack kills Danny within the confines of the hotel, Danny's spirit will be absorbed into the hotel itself, and the evil will take possession of Danny's shining ability, thus making it infinitely more powerful and able to extend itself beyond the actual Overlook itself. In the film, however, the motives of the evil are much more ambiguous, and are never fully clarified with any degree of certainty. There is no intimation whatsoever in the film that the hotel specifically wants Danny ('Danny Lloyd' (qv)). Instead, it seems much more concerned with Jack himself, and ensuring that Jack carry out the task of killing Danny and Wendy (although exactly why the hotel wants them dead is never explained). The implication in the film is that Jack is in some way tied to the hotel, as indicated in the final shot, the photograph from the 1921 July 4th ball (this photo is unique to the film; in the novel, there are no hints of any kind that Jack is connected to the hotel or has ever been there before). Danny's shining ability is only important insofar as he is able to sense the evil in the hotel which is closing in on his father; the hotel itself appears to have no real interest in him per se.\n\nThe character of Danny himself is also slightly different. Whilst he is in possession of a supernatural power in both book and film, and whilst the nature of his shining ability is relatively similar in text and on screen, the real difference is in the 'character' of Tony. In the book, Tony is Danny's future self, sending messages back through time to aid his younger persona. Indeed, at the end of the novel, it is revealed that Danny's middle name is Anthony. In the film, however, the status of Tony is far less important; he is presented simply as an imaginary friend. In this sense, Danny's description of him as \"the little boy who lives inside my mouth,\" is unique to the film.\n\nThe d\u00e9nouement is also very different in the novel and the film. In the novel, Hallorann is not killed. Jack bludgeons him with a mallet, but does not kill him, and ultimately, Hallorann escapes with Wendy and Danny. In the film, Hallorann ('Scatman Crothers' (qv)) is killed only moments after arriving at the hotel. Additionally, although Jack pursues Danny out into the grounds of the hotel in both novel and film, in the novel, the topiary animals come to life and begin to pursue the characters, whereas in the film there is a chase through a snow-covered hedge-maze (as is reasonably well known amongst fans, Kubrick did want to feature the living topiary animals, but after doing some special effects tests, he concluded that the scene could not be made to look realistic enough, hence the creation of the maze scenes as a replacement). Also, at the end of the novel, the Overlook Hotel is completely destroyed by a fire caused by an malfunctioning boiler. No such explosion takes place in the film, and the hotel is still very much standing at the end of the narrative. Indeed, in the film, the responsibilities of the Torrances regarding the boiler are never mentioned, but in the novel, Jack is supposed to dump the boiler every night. The film shows the boiler only once, as Wendy is in the basement prior to Jack's dream.\n\nThere are numerous other differences between the film and the novel. For example, the film's omission of the character of Horace Derwent (see below); indeed, in the novel, it is the ghost of Derwent who tells Jack to destroy the snowmobile. The film omits an explanation as to who the woman in room 237 is (see below). Jack's discovery of a scrapbook detailing the violent and sordid history of the hotel (it is seen on his desk in the film, but it is never mentioned) is deleted. In the film, Jack disables the CB radio by removing the battery and disables the snow cat by removing a piece of the engine, but in the novel, he destroys both with the use of a croquet mallet."], ["Why didn't 'Stephen King' (qv) adapt his own novel for the movie?", "Director 'Stanley Kubrick' (qv) was unimpressed with King's writing in general, saying,  I had seen _Carrie (1976)_ (qv), the film, but I have never read any of his novels. I should say that King's greatest ingenuity lies in the construction of the story. He does not seem to be very interested in writing itself. They say he wrote, read over, rewrote maybe once and sent everything to the editor. What seems to interest him is invention and I think that is his forte.\n In the early part of the production, Kubrick rejected a script written by King himself that was supposedly a much more literal adaptation of the novel, a more traditional horror film than Kubrick was interested in making. After turning down King, Kubrick was considering hiring novelist 'Diane Johnson' (qv) as a writing partner, as he was a great admirer of her novel The Shadow Knows (which he had strongly considered adapting into a film before ultimately deciding on _The Shining_ (qv)). Upon finding out that Johnson taught a course on Gothic literature at the University of Texas at Austin, he became convinced that she was the right person for the job, as he felt her knowledge of gothic themes and tropes could bring an interesting new perspective to the film. Johnson herself thought Kubrick chose her \"because he liked me better than 'Stephen King' (qv) or thought I was more tractable\" (quoted here)."], ["How did 'Stephen King' (qv) feel about the film?", "He was unimpressed; in the June 1986 edition of American Film, King was quoted as saying, It's like a great big beautiful Cadillac with no motor inside, you can sit in it and you can enjoy the smell of the leather upholstery - the only thing you can't do is drive it anywhere. So I would do everything different. The real problem is that Kubrick set out to make a horror picture with no apparent understanding of the genre. Everything about it screams that from beginning to end, from plot decisions to the final scene (the complete interview can be found here).\nIn particular, King disliked the casting of 'Jack Nicholson' (qv) as Jack Torrance. He felt that in the novel, it was pivotal that Jack is initially a good man who is slowly overcome by the forces of evil and who is fighting a losing battle against alcoholism. King was of the opinion that due to the casting of Nicholson, who was well known for playing unstable characters, Jack in the film is very much on the edge when the story begins, and the character does not possess the inner goodness so vital to Jack of the novel. King wanted to cast someone who could play the character as more genial in the early stages; apparently he was very keen on 'Jon Voight' (qv). He was also hugely disappointed that the themes of the evils of alcoholism and the disintegration of the family unit were relatively unimportant in the film."], ["Of the three versions of the film, which one is the 'official' version?", "As is explained here, there are three different versions of _The Shining_ (qv); the original 146 minute version which included the coda, the subsequent 144 minute version without the coda, and the 113 minute 'European version'. All three versions were approved by Kubrick himself, making it difficult to conclusively call any of them the definitive version. Today, the 144 minute version is the one most readily available on DVD and Home Video, and as such, is generally considered to be the 'Director's Cut'. However, evidence suggests that this version may not be Kubrick's preferred version. The last version of the film on which Kubrick himself worked was the 113 minute version, which he approved for theatrical release outside the United States. Additionally, when the film was first released on Home Video in the United States, in 1981, Kubrick endorsed the 113 minute version as the 'official version' of the film, not the 144 minute version. So strictly speaking, whilst it is common practice to assume that the longest cut of a film must be the director's preferred version, in this case, the opposite is true; Kubrick seems to have actually preferred the shorter cut. A detailed comparison between the European Version and the 144 minute American Version, with images, can be found here."], ["What are some of the themes of the film?", "As examined above, 'Bill Blakemore' (qv) reads _The Shining_ (qv) as a protest against the genocide of Native Americans. As will be examined below, Frederic Jameson reads it as a lament for the clear political demarcation of the Cold War, whilst Geoffrey Wright argues it is a metaphorical study of the Holocaust. Over the years, the film has run the gamut of critical interpretation, producing all sorts of disparate and wide-ranging readings; from a self-reflexive examination of the filmic medium to a deconstruction of the horror genre, from an analysis of the breakdown of the family unit to a deeply pessimistic portrait of contemporary American society, from the Cold War to the Holocaust to the genocide of Native Americans. As 'Jonathan Romney' (qv) points out, \"the copious critical literature on _The Shining_ (qv) reads it variously as a commentary on the breakdown of the family, the crisis of masculinity, the state of modern America and its ideologies, sex\u00adism, racism and the dominance of big business\" (quoted here).\n\nSo, with that said, what exactly is the film about? Are some of these critics correct, are none of them correct, or are all of them correct? As with so many of Kubrick's films, these are questions which will almost certainly never be definitely answered; the safest interpretation of them all seems to be that the ultimate meaning of the film is protean, different for each viewer, different for each critic, and no one interpretation takes precedence over any other. To say the film is about Native Americans is not to say it can't be about the Holocaust, to say it is about the horror genre is not to say it can't be about the dysfunctionality of contemporary American society. In the end, some see the film as a simple horror story with no wider implications whatsoever, whilst others see it as a deeply meaningful film in which the horror story serves only to act as a vehicle to transport a more profound meaning. Neither interpretation is entirely correct, but neither is entirely wrong. The film invites disparate critical readings, it is reluctant to fully reveal itself, and for that reason, it will surely remain a veritable carte blanche, inviting critics to inscribe onto it whatever meaning they may choose.\n\nThe following represents an extremely small cross section of critical writing on the film, but it does serve to illustrate the vast scope of critical interpretations which have been generated:\n\nJack Kroll (film/theatre critic), in his review at the time of the film's release, argued that it was essentially about domesticity, a study of a family unit gone terribly awry: \"For all its brilliant effects, the strongest and scariest element in _The Shining_ (qv) is the face of 'Jack Nicholson' (qv) undergoing a metamorphosis from affectionate father to murderous demon [...] The real horror of the film is expressed in Torrance's frustration. No blood vision or demon lover or putrefying corpse is as frightening as the moment when Wendy looks at the writing that Jack has supposedly been working on and finds that it consists of reams of paper with the single sentence, \"All work and no play makes Jack a dull boy,\" repeated in endless typographical variations. This scene is more frightening than, for example, the brilliant special effect in which one of the hotel's beautiful art-deco hallways literally begins to bleed through its wall in what becomes a torrent of blood. The sight of Torrance's endlessly repeated sentence chills you with its revelation of a man so clogged and aching with frustrated creativity that his desire to kill doesn't need to be explained by his seizure by sinister and suppurating creatures from a time warp of pure evil. When Torrance turns on his son in a mad rage, _The Shining_ (qv) becomes a kind of perverse reversal of _Kramer vs. Kramer_ (qv), where father and son found mutual flowering in each other\" (\"'Stanley Kubrick' (qv)'s Horror Show\", Newsweek Magazine (June 2, 1980); available here).\n\nPauline Kael (film historian/critic), in her scathing review of the film, argued that it was about violence, and Mankind's predilection for violence through the ages: \"_The Shining_ (qv) seems to be about the quest for immortality -- the immortality of evil. Men are psychic murderers: they want to be free and creative, and can only take out their frustrations on their terrified wives and children [...] It's what Kubrick said in 2001: Mankind began with the weapon and just went on from there. Redrum (\"murder\" backward). Kubrick is the man who thought it necessary to introduce a godlike force (the black slab) to account for evolution. It was the slab that told the apelike man to pick up the bone and use it as a weapon. This was a new version of Original Sin: man the killer acts on God's command. Somehow, Kubrick ducked out on the implications of his own foolishness when he gave 2001 its utopian, technological ending -- man, reborn out of science, as angelic, interplanetary fetus. Now he seems to have gone back to his view at the beginning of 2001: man is a murderer, throughout eternity. The bone that was high in the air has turned into Jack's axe, held aloft, and Jack, crouched over, making wild, inarticulate sounds as he staggers in the maze, has become the ape\" (\"_The Shining_ (qv) Review\", New York Review, (October 9, 1980); available here).\n\n'Paul Mayersberg' (qv) (writer, director, film critic), in an article for Sight and Sound, argued that the film was primarily about two issues: the breakdown of the family unit on the one hand and a commentary on the filmic medium on the other: \"The central horror of _The Shining_ (qv) is family life. For a child there can be few characters more frightening than his angry father. Danny, despite his stoicism, is terrorized by his father. Wendy is terrorized by her violent husband. Jack is frustrated to the point of rejection and violent aggression towards his family. It is a nice picture of American home life. _The Shining_ (qv) is an accidental but none the less effective reworking of _Kramer vs. Kramer_ (qv). Both treat the collapsing single child family [...] Shining denotes the ability to communicate telepathically, to see backwards into the past and forwards into the future. _The Shining_ (qv) is nothing more nor less than a metaphor for the cinema itself. Film has the shining. Danny is probably the director of the movie. He is certainly identified with the camera. The Steadicam tracking shots through the hotel corridors and then in the maze evoke the exhilaration of a small boy racing about on his tricycle. He imagines himself to be a machine. Kubrick plays with the Steadicam like a toy. It is essentially childlike. He wants to find out all the things he can do with his latest acquisition. Danny's visions are represented in cuts, in montage, so the boy is not only the camera he is also the moviola\" (\"The Overlook Hotel\", Sight and Sound (Winter, 1980); available here).\n\nP.L. Titterington (film critic), in a Sight and Sound article written a few months after the film's release, argued that it was a metaphorical study of contemporary American society, in particular the break down of the so-called American Dream, and a pessimistic contrast between the promise America offered when it was first discovered and what it has today become, a place of isolated individuals where human communication is no longer possible: \"One of the major themes of _The Shining_ (qv) is America. As 'Altman' (qv) used a single city as a microcosm in _Nashville_ (qv), and 'Coppola' (qv) the behavior of America in Vietnam in _Apocalypse Now_ (qv), so Kubrick presents his view of America through the image of the haunted luxury hotel [...] _The Shining_ (qv) works primarily through elements that evoke America's past history and the present state of its society. The huge opening helicopter shots suggest an openness of space before the claustrophobia of the story sets in. But they also evoke the vast spaces the pioneers had to cross in the founding of America. The helicopter shots suggest the exhilaration of a new found continent and a new life, the energy and hope and promise of the pioneering experience; but as we focus on Torrance's car far below in the forests and by the side of lakes, there is also the sense of the dwarfing of the pioneer, the danger of isolation and of being overwhelmed by the sheer size of the landscape. The dark side of the American experience is paramount in the film. The early exhilaration is soon lost and the contrast starkly made between the open spaces and the hotel surrounded by the freezing cold, the two faces of America, the early hopeful past marred by inhumanity and the luxurious present that has inherited that legacy [...] In intimate relationship with these evocations and deeply buried associations with the American past, Kubrick presents a whole series of images drawn from the American present, and in particular those images most associated with it in the popular imagination: the family car outing, the game of ball, the nude pin-ups, the TV news, the job interview, the Independence Day celebrations. Insignia of different kinds are used on jerseys and T shirts: the American Eagle, 'Apollo USA', Mickey Mouse. _The Shining_ (qv) incorporates all these images and references, but perhaps the most important are those connected with marriage and the family: the loss of contact between individuals, the suppressed frustration, hostility and violence, in the early stages glimpsed in Torrance's irritability, sometimes flaring up into anger and abuse, in the latter stages turning to murderous aggression. By attempting to write a novel, Torrance seems to be desperately trying to give meaning to his life, after a past of routine jobs and heavy drinking. The whole relationship becomes a gruesome parody of a marriage, including its details of black humor (Torrance's \"Honey, I'm home\" as the axe smashes through the door), the burlesque of the language of romantic love - \"light of my life\" - and the parody of the bedtime story as Torrance tries to force the door behind which his wife and son are hiding, with Torrance himself as the \"big bad wolf\"\" (\"Kubrick and _The Shining_ (qv)\", Sight and Sound (Spring, 1981); available here)\n\nFrederic Jameson (literary scholar/political theorist) argues that the film is about a drive for community, a lament for a notion of Cold War-esque politics when political demarcations and social hierarchies were clearer than they are in the 1980s, and finding a \"knowable community\" was easier: \"The drive towards community, the longing for collectivity, the envy of other, achieved collectivities, emerges with all force of a return of the repressed: and this is finally, I think, what _The Shining_ (qv) is all about. Where to search for this \"knowable community,\" to which, even excluded, the fantasy of collective relations might attach itself? It is surely not to be found in the managerial bureaucracy of the hotel itself, as multinational and standardized as a bedroom community or a motel chain; nor can it any longer take seriously the departing vacationers of the current holiday season, on their way home to their own privatized dwelling places. It only has one direction to go, into the past [...] Kubrick's film foregrounds and isolates a single period, multiplying increasingly unified signals: tuxedoes, roadsters, hipflasks, slicked-down hair parted in the middle [...] That generation is the twenties, and it is by the twenties that the hero is haunted and possessed. The twenties were the last moment in which a genuine American leisure class led an aggressive and ostentatious public existence, in which an American ruling class projected a class-conscious and unapologetic image of itself and enjoyed its privileges without guilt, openly and armed with its emblems of top-hat and champagne glass, on the social stage in full view of the other classes. The nostalgia of _The Shining_ (qv), the longing for collectivity, takes the peculiar form of an obsession with the last period in which class consciousness is out in the open [...] Arguably, the golden age of the fifties Science Fiction film, with its pod people and brain-eating monsters, testified to a genuine collective paranoia, that of the fantasies of the Cold War period, fantasies of influence and subversion which reinforce the very ideological climate they reproduce. Such films projected the figure of the \"enemy\" in the individually monstrous, the collective organization of the latter being at best conceivable as a biological or instinctive sub-human network like the dynamics of an anthill. But today, where information about the planet has become far more widely diffused through the media, and where with the great movement of decolonization of the 1960s, the most repressed collectivities have begun to speak in their own voice and to project the demands of properly revolutionary subjects, it is no longer possible to represent Otherness in this way. It is not clear, for instance, that the political unconscious of America today can still conceive of the Russians as evil, in the sense of the alien otherness and facelessness of these earlier fantasies: at best, clumsy and brutal, heavy-handed, as in current evaluations of the invasion of Afghanistan. As for the formerly faceless horde of the Chinese, they are now our loyal ally and have reintegrated the earlier wartime fantasy of the \"friendship\" between China and America, while our former Vietnamese enemy - no longer, in any case, a global ideological threat - enjoys the grudging prestige of the victor. The Third World, generally, immobilized in a post-revolutionary situation by military dictatorship, corruption, and sheer economic distress, no longer offers adequate materials for the fantasies of a beleaguered Fortress America, submerged by the rising tide of militant underclasses. This is the situation in which the new wave of occult films (they can be dated from 1973, the year of The Exorcist as well as of the global economic crisis which marked the end of the sixties as such) may rather be seen as expressing the nostalgia for a system in which Good and Evil are absolute black-and-white categories: they do not express a new Cold War psychology as much as they express the longing and the regret for a Cold War period in which things were still simple, not so much belief in Manichaean forces as the nagging suspicion that everything would be so much easier if we could believe in them. _The Shining_ (qv), then, though not an occult film, nonetheless envelops the new ideological genre of the occult of its larger critical perspective, allowing us to reinterpret this still \"metaphysical\" nostalgia for an absolute Evil in the far more materialistic terms of a yearning for the certainties and satisfactions of a traditional class system\" (\"Historicism in _The Shining_ (qv)\" (1981), from Signatures of the Visible (1992); available here).\n\n'Jonathan Romney' (qv) (film critic), in an article written shortly after Kubrick's death in 1999, argues that the film is anything but \"a failed genre piece,\" and instead it is a film of multiple meanings and hidden depth: \"At first sight this is an extremely simple, even static film [...] At the time of the film's release many critics were unimpressed by this schema - Kubrick had put so much effort into his film, building vast sets at Elstree, making a 17-week shoot stretch to 46, and what was the result? A silly scare story - something that, it was remarked at the time, 'Roger Corman' (qv) could have turned around in a fortnight. But look beyond the simplicity and the Overlook reveals itself as a palace of paradox [...] The film's subtexts resonate in the vastness as in a sound box. It's the space itself that allows so many thematic strands to emerge from an ostensibly sim\u00adple narrative, whether or not they are explicitly delineated. The copious critical literature on _The Shining_ (qv) reads it variously as a commentary on the breakdown of the family, the crisis of masculinity, the state of modern America and its ideologies, sex\u00adism, racism and the dominance of big business. But what gives the film its curiously resistant, opaque feel - which makes it possible for critics to conclude that [i]_The Shining_ (qv) is really about nothing at all, simply a botched genre job - is the fact that this is a film about the experience of watching _The Shining_ (qv). The subject is not only possession but film as possession; seeing the Torrances in their different ways bewitched by the Overlook, we can't help wondering what's happening to us as we watch them. Are we as skeptical of the hotel's legends as Jack seems to be when first told of the Grady killings? Or are we transfixed, eyes gaping like Danny? A recurring ques\u00adtion in horror cinema is how our reactions are affected by seeing other people in the grip of terror: are we terrified out of empathy, or do we distance our\u00adselves with cool skepticism?\" (\"'Stanley Kubrick' (qv), 1928-1999: Resident Phantoms\", Sight and Sound (September, 1999); available here).\n\nGeoffrey Wright of the Alt.Movies.Kubrick FAQ argues that the film is a metaphor for a dysfunctional American society where the white male hegemony is buckling under its own weight: \"What the American society does to its population is represented metaphorically through the characters. Hallorann represents minorities: When they get uppity, it kills them. Wendy represents women: Outwardly weak and superficial, watches soap operas, clings to a violent husband who despises her because of hopeless feelings of need and fear of independence. Characterized by submissiveness, martyrdom and fear. Danny represents children: Brutalized; personality and independence squashed, channeled into fantasy; split personality -- Tony represents the redirection of Danny's ability to gather information which is taboo; now Tony is the one responsible. Jack represents the inheritor, provider, and caretaker of society: The squashed child grown up; no creativity, no real feeling of self worth, extreme anger at recognition of these and redirection of this anger toward the family he sees as his possession over which he rightfully commands complete control; inability to love, desire to control to the point of killing anyone who would dare defy him. Menial work is beneath him. In fact the \"caretaker\" does no work, which is the job of his slavish wife. Anyone who thinks this society is kind to the white male dominators didn't understand what Kubrick was trying to say through Jack. He has had it the worst in many respects\" (quoted here).\n\nKian Bergstrom (film critic), argues that the film is an interrogation of an audience who come to horror movies to see suffering and death: \"Kubrick again and again asks us to look at why we came to _The Shining_ (qv) and to feel ashamed. How small, how petty we are, to expect to be entertained by watching an abusive alcoholic terrorize his enabling and confused wife and disturbed son (whom we know he has a history of beating). How pathetic of us that we would imagine spooks and spirits to be scarier than a man who attacks his wife with an axe. There's very little gore, but there's enough to make very certain we're thinking about how little blood there is in the film [...] Kubrick knows that we have come expecting to be scared in part through the making visible of guts and organs, and he laughs at us. \"Oh, really?\" we might imagine his disembodied voice cackling; \"this place is so scary, they eat the gore.\" After the film is over, with its final images being those of repetitions and broken closures, the cycle of the film feels more like its gearing up for another round than ending. As far as catharsis goes, as far even as explanation goes, we're left after the film without a sense that either took place for us, but should have, that somehow, we missed 'it,' or didn't get 'it.'\" (\"\"I am sorry to differ with you, sir\": Thoughts On Reading Kubrick's _The Shining_ (qv)\" (2000); available here).\n\nGeoffrey Cocks (film scholar), in his 2004 biographical study of Kubrick films, argues that it is an analysis of the fears produced by the Holocaust and the threat of Nuclear War during the 1940s: \"In _The Shining_ (qv) there slouches a deeply laid subtext that positions the Holocaust as the modern benchmark of evil. An analysis of many otherwise inexplicable visual and aural aspects of film demonstrates that this film was an artistic and a philosophical response to the horrors of the Second World War [...] The \"Big Bad Wolf\" in _The Shining_ (qv), is the product of many years of cultural evolution and reflects in particular the transformation wrought in the symbolic meaning of the wolf during the 1930s and 1940s. It is also an indication that European and world events surrounding the threat and reality of war against the West and against the Jews were of greater moment to the solidly and securely bourgeois precocious Kubrick than poverty, unemployment, and economic catastrophe [...] Any mention of the wolf in _The Shining_ (qv) is a(n) (in)direct expression of a growing preoccupation in the 1970s on Kubrick's (and the culture's) part with the subject of Nazis, the Second World War, and the Holocaust. In this respect, it is significant that Jack, like the Big Bad Wolf, does not make it through the door to get at his wife, but remains on the other side. This is in line with Kubrick's use of camera, film, and narrative and symbolic indirection as a means of distance from and control over the subject of the Holocaust in particular. Instead of his wife and son, Jack Torrance's only victim (besides himself) will be Hallorann, the black cook whose arrival at the Overlook Hotel just as Jack has broken through the bathroom door saves the lives of Wendy and Danny Torrance. By having an African-American as the victim of Jack's and the hotel's murderous rage, Kubrick underlines a twinned theme in _The Shining_ (qv) of an American and, underneath, a German past of racial persecution\" (excerpts from The Wolf at the Door: 'Stanley Kubrick' (qv), History, and the Holocaust (2004); available here)."], ["Is the miniseries a remake of this movie?", "No. Both the film and the miniseries are inspired by the 'Stephen King' (qv) novel, but the mini-series version does not draw any inspiration from Kubrick's film.

Then she awakens and we find out this was a nightmare. In the Director's cut, there is an added scene later on where Burke sits down and tells Ripley that her daughter has died at age 66. So it's likely the initial meeting with Burke where he reunites her with Jones the cat and informs her how long she's been in hypersleep was real, but she had a recurring nightmare where that discussion went a very bad way."], ["How is it that Ripley was rescued?", "Her escape shuttle was found drifting through space by a salvage team.

However, in Alien, it clearly drools quite a bit before Ripley \"blows it out of the airlock.\" Is the Company hiding this?", "Ripley's shuttle decompressed shortly after the Alien drooled on the floor. The subsequent air displacement was strong enough to almost blow the Alien out (had it not held on), so it is imaginable that most of the drool blew out/evaporated quickly. After being adrift in space for 57 years, any remaining drool would certainly have evaporated. However, since the Alien was bleeding when Ripley hit it with the harpoon, some drops of acid may have scorched the floor or wall, and because saliva also contains organic molecules, trace amounts of proteins should have been discovered if the team had done a thorough job. Since the discovery of some proteins and/or scorch marks is hardly conclusive evidence, it is very likely that the Company simply lied to Ripley and used it as a way to demote her and thereby silence her about the Alien (they may have plans for it yet). She would be fully accountable for the destruction of the Nostromo, which would enable the Company to get their lost money back through insurance. In the novel of the film (taken from the original shooting script), Ripley comments to Burke that the evidence had been tampered with, and later, when Burke is confronted with the extensive damage to the colony complex, he remarks that the complex is insured anyway."], ["In the 57 years that Ripley was in hypersleep, why didn't the Company send another crew out to investigate LV-426?", "This is not made completely clear in any of the films, though there are plausible explanations. One reason may be that the Company's secret attempts to obtain the Alien were only known by a few of its executives (the ones who re-routed the Nostromo to get into LV-426's vicinity) and that they were no longer in a position to send another team to LV-426 after the events of the first film. Another reason could be that they simply had no opportunity: with the Nostromo gone missing as there were undoubtedly large inquiries done which would only have drawn attention to their unethical acquisition of the Alien. In that case, the Company probably had little other choice than to bury the project.\n\nAbout thirty years after the events of the first film, the Company begins terraforming the planet and a colony is set up there. However, neither the colonists nor any Company employees seem to know anything about the Derelict Ship until Ripley arrives back at Earth 20 years later (and the warning signal coming from the derelict ship was presumably deactivated or no longer operating after the Nostromo visited the planet). Burke then instructs the colonists to investigate the Derelict Ship, which supports the notion that the Company's information about the Alien and their plans to obtain it were either deliberately buried or simply lost in the 57 years it took Ripley to return to Earth, and no one involved in this earlier attempt was in power anymore (otherwise they would have sent out someone earlier). In the colony's information log, Ripley later reads that Burke sent the colonists to the Derelict Ship directly after hearing about it from her testimony.\n\nBurke says he did this for three reasons: (1) he wasn't certain that there even was a Derelict Ship on the planet, (2) making it an official investigation rather than a coincidental finding would make it a security situation, resulting in the loss of any rights to anything found on the planet, and (3) he hoped to obtain an Alien specimen and make millions by selling it for bio-weapons research. While on Earth, Burke may have had access to classified Company documents that detailed their earlier attempt to obtain the Alien and sacrificed an entire crew to get it; he then simply chose to follow up on that plan; or he just heard Ripley's story about the Alien and thought it was an interesting species for the bioweapon research program, not knowing the Company had tried to get one 57 years before."], ["Why didn't the colonists on LV-426 pick up the warning beacon from the derelict ship?", "The colonists were sent to LV-426 with no knowledge of a derelict ship or any warning that the planet may harbor a dangerous alien lifeform, so they had no reason to go looking for them. They may not have detected the derelict's beacon because it was no longer sending out a signal. In a graphic novel released by Heavy Metal two months before the movie release, when Dallas ('Tom Skerritt' (qv)), Kane ('John Hurt' (qv)), and Lambert ('Veronica Cartwright' (qv)) enter the derelict ship, Dallas twists a knob near the base of the giant's chair and turns off the signal. Although this is not strictly canon, this event also occurs in the original shooting script for Alien. In a 1986 issue of the magazine Starlog, and in an extended scene with the derelict ship in _Aliens_ (qv): Special Edition, it is shown/described that the ship is visibly damaged by volcanic activity, i.e., a lava flow has crushed the derelict ship against a rock outcropping, ripping open its hull. This damage may well have silenced the signal (this is also James Cameron's preferred explanation). It's been suggested that the signal stopped broadcasting as soon as the crew of the Nostromo entered the derelict (though this is unlikely as there would be no sense in programming a warning signal to deactivate and thereby risk other visitors coming to investigate). Whatever the reason the colonists were not alerted by the warning beacon, the original script did call for them to eventually find the derelict, although that information did not make it into the movie. In fact, it was Newt ('Carrie Henn' (qv))'s father who found the derelict and he was attacked by a Facehugger much like it happened to Kane in Alien. Like on the Nostromo, the Alien then hatched and quickly began to go after the rest of the colonists. By the time Ripley and the Marines got there, Newt was the only one of the 158 colonists left. This scene was restored in the special edition."], ["Wouldn't the colonist have found the Derelict Ship by themselves in 20 years?", "The initial investigation of the Nostromo crew already indicated that the planetoid's atmosphere was primordial, and therefore incapable of sustaining complex life. LV-426 is described during Ripley's hearing as \"a rock with no indigenous life\". It stands to reason that the Company did thorough checks of the planet, determining that its soil was incapable of sustaining life, and therefore suitable for terraforming. They simply didn't bother to check the entire planet surface for signs of life or external civilization, or perhaps the Derelict Ship itself blends in with the surroundings so much that it doesn't stick out on any scan or picture made from above. The first decade, the colonists were probably busy building the Colony Complex and Atmosphere Processor, leaving little time to explore the planet's surface, where nothing is expected to be found anyway. Exploring the surface would be much harder without a breathable atmosphere, so this was probably limited to the direct vicinity of the Colony Complex. It is also suggested that the Derelict ship is quite far away. As soon as the air became breathable, the colonists probably did active surveys of the planet. In the extended edition, it is suggested that the Derelict ship was in fairly uncharted territory, described as \"past the Ilium range, in the middle of nowhere\". Also, the surveyors took their kids with them, suggesting that the distance back and forth couldn't be conveniently covered within a day, and the ship is not in the near vicinity. This makes a random discovery unlikely, also because the terrain is rocky, and the atmosphere causes cloud formation and mist, which would have made the ship harder to detect when one doesn't know what to look for. It is only on Burke's instructions and with precise coordinates that the colonists found the ship."], ["Why does Ripley agree to return to LV-426?", "Ripley is initially reluctant to go back to the planet, even after she hears that over 60 colonist families now live there and that the Company have lost contact with them. However, Ripley keeps having terrifying nightmares about the Alien, and most likely feels the best way to deal with the problem is to face it head on and ensure the Alien species is wiped out forever. Her motives may also have been partly more mercenary, as she lost her position as a Warrant Officer and could only find work as a cargo loader after her return to Earth. The Company agrees to restore her previous position with them on the condition that she goes back to the planet as a consultant with a team of marines to investigate why they have lost contact with the colonists. However, given the fact that she makes her decision to return immediately after another nightmare, it seems that her intent to wipe out the _Aliens_ (qv) is her main drive. In interviews, director/screenwriter James Cameron drew parallels with Vietnam war veterans suffering from shell shock, post-traumatic stress disorder and/or survivor's guilt, who were nevertheless among the troopers to do a second tour to Vietnam."], ["Each of the marines had their first initial on their helmet cameras; what are their first names?", "Each marine's first name is the same as the actor who played them.

Is there a connection to Starship Troopers?", "Pvt Hudson comments about the mission being \"just another bug-hunt,\" possibly implying that the marines have encountered alien species before, as does Pvt Frost in the mess hall scene, when he reminisces about \"Arcturian poontang.\" Under the cockpit window of the drop ship is a picture of the marines' mascot: an eagle brandishing a machine-gun and wearing boots with the slogan, \"bug stompers,\" which implies that such is their specialty. Elsewhere on the marines' uniforms are patches with similar images of an eagle and the slogan, \"We endanger species.\" A \"bug hunt\" could also simply mean that they've been sent on several wild goose chases with no aliens to be found, which would explain their derision about it being another false alarm. James Cameron revealed on the DVD commentary that he had all the actors playing marines read Starship Troopers; this is a nod to the inspiration of that book.\n\nHowever, the most likely reason is that \"bug hunt\" was slang for a search-and-rescue mission, which seemed a rather second-rate challenge than a \"stand up fight\", which, in Hudson's terms, meant being sent down to a war-ridden planet to aid in some sort of violent dispute where there will be lots of combat. When Gorman says, \"All we know is there's still NO CONTACT with the colony and that a xenomorph may be involved.\" It meant they would be going in to look for missing colonists, to which Hicks replies, \"It's a bug-hunt.\" which corroborates with the slang theory. Then he asks, \"What exactly are we dealing with here?\" to which Ripley steps in to explain the circumstances of the colonists going missing.\n\nIt is likely the marines uniform slogans about being \"bug stompers\" is merely coincidence (done so because of the Starship Troopers novel), as if they specialized in dealing with alien species or had been sent on wild goose chases before in regards to aliens, then they would've been a little more serious in the briefing, knowing that there have been past inquiries as to extraterrestrial existence. But they scoff at Ripley's story, just as the Company executives did, because there hadn't been anything relating to extraterrestrials recorded in \"over 300 surveyed worlds\". Unlike Star Wars, which has thousands of different species, this universe is portrayed as a humans-only dimension, as the concept of the original film was to depict what it would actually be like to encounter an alien.\n\nThere is also the explanation, supported by some dialogue, that the bug hunt suggests that they have to kill aliens from space (not the alien of the film), but the extraterrestrial life is limited to vermin or lower form of life. Hudson being impressed about Ripley seeing an \"alien\" sound like he has seen many before when the marines have been on bug hunt. The hearing committee also comment that the Nostromo crew found something never seen before in 300 worlds, making the life-cycle of the Alien rather unique and more threatening than the other Alien-species out there in the world (including the so-called Arcturians). To sum up: there are different alien-species in the world, and the ALIEN of this film appears to be the most sophisticated and dangerous."], ["Why is Hudson so freaked out after the first encounter with the _Aliens_ (qv)?", "Prior to his encounter with the _Aliens_ (qv), Hudson is only concerned that this is going to be another \"bug hunt\". During the first encounter with the aliens, his point of view changes drastically. He probably did not expect the _Aliens_ (qv) to put up much of a fight or to be so unstoppable against all their superior military weaponry. He also loses his composure after seeing many of his squad claimed by the _Aliens_ (qv). He is one of the very few marines to survive the encounter. As they set up a barricade, Hudson begins to slowly sink into a state of paranoia, even questioning Ripley's judgment and her ideas of survival. Eventually, Ripley calms him down stating \"We really need you and I'm sick of your bullshit.\" -- she acts like an officer, a position she was promised by Burke if she went with the Marines on their mission. Hudson starts to gain control of his fears, partly because Ripley is acting like an officer & he'll fall in line & also because he suddenly remembers what his job entails -- acting like a soldier. When the _Aliens_ (qv) overrun Operations, Hudson fights without fear, constantly taunting the _Aliens_ (qv) and gunning them down at will. Secondly, from a film making perspective, Hudson represents \"the audience\". By portraying him as panicking and stricken with fear, it represents what normal people would do if they were in a similar situation. After all, if none of the characters were shown to be afraid of the aliens, they wouldn't seem nearly as menacing. It also allows the audience to develop a sense of compassion and empathy for the on screen characters -- right before the aliens mount their final attack, even Hicks seems afraid. The role of the audience was portrayed by the Lambert character in the first film."], ["Why do the Alien heads look so different from the first film?", "Numerous behind-the-scenes pictures and documentaries of Alien show the Alien's head with ridges, but the special effects artists covered it with a gelatinous substance, causing the head to appear smooth. The reason for the different look in _Aliens_ (qv) is that director James Cameron thought the Alien head looked more interesting with the ridges visible, so the special effects team left out the gel. According to the extras from the DVD, Cameron also didn't want to have the clear dome on the Alien's head, as he thought it would be prone to breaking. To stay within the continuity of the saga, one could argue that _Aliens_ (qv) are \"born\" with a smooth head and that this cover falls off after a while, exposing the ridges. Another proposed theory is that _Aliens_ (qv), similar to bees and ants, can differentiate into different castes (including Queens); the original script also called for much smaller, albino versions of the _Aliens_ (qv), serving as worker drones in the Queen's lair, to care for the eggs. The adult _Aliens_ (qv) seen in this movie are considered Warrior _Aliens_ (qv), who are bred for combat and defense of their hive."], ["Why didn't the Facehuggers burn through their stasis tubes like through Kane's helmet in Alien?", "The most likely explanation is that the stasis fluid neutralizes their acidic blood or that the stasis tubes were resistant to it."], ["Why didn't Ripley, Newt and the marines try to avoid the _Aliens_ (qv) by crawling out the complex through the same tube as Bishop did?", "A point could be made that the confrontation with the _Aliens_ (qv) might have been avoided if everyone had simply followed Bishop by crawling through the duct towards the uplink tower. However, this would have been unwise from a strategic point. Following the battle in the atmosphere processor basement, the nest has been awakened, and the _Aliens_ (qv) can be expected to actively pursue the survivors, especially at night. In fact, Bishop is taking quite a risk by getting to the uplink tower 'with all those things running around': one of the _Aliens_ (qv) stowing away on the first dropship and subsequently causing it to crash already proves that the creatures do not limit their movements to indoor spaces. There was even an unfilmed scene in the original screenplay where Bishop encountered an Alien while crawling through the conduit. Bishop simply didn't have a choice because someone had to get out and pilot the second dropship down. However, an entire group of marines would not be safe outside, where it is cold and wet, and the danger can come from all sides, making the group that much harder to defend. So the best strategy would be to lock themselves into the main colony building, sealing all doors that lead in and setting up sentry guns (in the Special Edition) while waiting for Bishop to get the second ship down, and then mount an escape through the front door. However, nobody considered that the _Aliens_ (qv) would find a quick way into the building. Trying to use the conduit to escape at that time was impossible, given the time it would take to weld it open again. Also, Newt warns them that they should get inside because it would be dark soon and \"They mostly come at night...mostly.\""], ["Why did Burke unleash the two Facehuggers to kill Ripley?", "When Ripley learned that Burke intended to secretly bring the Facehuggers back to Earth for bioweapon research, she threatened to alert the Earth authorities that he was smuggling in dangerous organisms. She further vowed to report him for his role in the slaughter of the colonists as he sent them to the derelict ship without warning them of what was inside. However, Burke's intention wasn't to kill Ripley but to get her and Newt impregnated with the alien embryos, then freeze their bodies in order to get them through quarantine. He figured that no one would know what they were carrying inside, and they were simply the only two at the time who were isolated enough for the impregnation to succeed."], ["How did Burke release the Facehuggers into the med lab without himself getting attacked by them?", "The Facehuggers were being kept in stasis tubes in the Med Lab. The most probable explanation is that Burke returned to the Med Lab after bringing Lt Gorman to Operations. He then placed the tubes on slow drain just before he left the Lab again. When the fluid in the stasis tubes had drained sufficiently, the Facehuggers revived enough to escape from the tubes themselves. It's possible that, in addition to the stasis fluid neutralizing the effects of the acid, they might have had some sort of analgesic that also numbed them and reduced their considerable strength. Once the tubes had drained and the analgesic had worn off, they could pop the covers of the tubes and escape."], ["Are the _Aliens_ (qv) intelligent enough to intentionally 'cut the power'?", "In the previous movie, the one Alien was smart enough to single out mostly individual victims instead of a group (Brett, Dallas), and to stow away on the shuttle when the Nostromo was set to self-destruct. This implies a reasonable capacity for thinking. However, it did menace Lambert, seemingly not realizing or caring that Parker was armed with a flamethrower (to the Alien's luck, Parker couldn't use it without harming Lambert anyway). In the DVD commentary, James Cameron states that the _Aliens_ (qv) in _Aliens_ (qv) had been alive for a few weeks at least and, thus, had plenty of time to adapt and learn. Some viewers say that the _Aliens_ (qv) have more than enough capacity to reason that humans are dependent on light and electrical energy. It cannot be clearly deduced how intelligent _Aliens_ (qv) are. They eventually learn to stay away from the sentry guns (in the Special Edition), but it takes them quite a number of sacrifices before they find out. This suggests that they learn through a process of trial-and-error. Generally speaking, the quicker an organism learns, the more intelligence it possesses. Just like small children, they need to experience it first before they can learn anything about it. It is very much possible that they damaged a conduit by accident earlier in life, noticed how it caused the power to go out, and used that knowledge to intentionally cut the power later. Others postulate that the introduction of a Queen indicates that the _Aliens_ (qv) are a hive species, reducing the _Aliens_ (qv) to mere drones with no more intelligence than a very evolved insect. By this reasoning, the _Aliens_ (qv) did not intentionally cut the power, but accidentally damaged some electrical conduits, probably while they were finding ways into the complex through the ceiling. Staying with the insectoid/hive mind idea, along with the insinuated intelligence of the Queen, it is possible that the Queen learned of human's dependency on power and lighting through observation, and then ordered the drones/warriors to cut the power (even though they may or may not have understood why they did it)."], ["How intelligent is the Queen?", "The Queen seems to display a fair ability to reason. She recognises the threat that Ripley's flamethrower poses (after some demonstration) and then calls off her warrior _Aliens_ (qv). She is also able to figure out how an elevator works; notice that Ripley needs to press the switch in order to go up; the Queen must have done the same to reach the platform. It is unclear whether she knew this procedure ahead of time or whether she was imitating Ripley's actions (although it is possible that the elevator goes back up automatically, as it did when Ripley first came down into the sub levels and the elevator closed and departed after she disembarked). She also appears to know how to safely hitchhike on a dropship (or was it lucky chance that she ended up safe in the landing strut bay?). This opens the possibility that it is just the Queen that displays intelligence, and the warrior _Aliens_ (qv) simply obey her."], ["How did Hicks' face get burned?", "When Ripley and Hicks are escaping, they enter an elevator, as the door closes an alien forces its way through and so Hicks shoots it. The result has the acid splashing all over Hicks' armor and he likely got small spatters on his arms and face. Aboard the dropship, Hicks has bandages all over his upper torso and around his head as well. In subsequent comic book adaptations (which are an alternate storyline from where Alien 3 went) show Hicks with a scar on the left side of his face. As he was leaving the elevator with Ripley he clearly had black scorch marks on the left side of his face which were likely a result of his getting some arterial spray."], ["Who is Pvt. Wierzbowski? Is he even seen?", "He is mainly seen running in the background but blends in with the others, so it's hard to discern who he is in each scene. However, he does have two close-up shots.

They first referred to as xenomorphs by Lt.

In the expanded universe, some of the comic books give the species the name Linguafoeda acheronsis (meaning \"vile tongue from Acheron\"), but this has not actually been mentioned in any of the movies.

With only 19 minutes left before the complex blows up, Ripley forces Bishop to fly to the atmosphere processor, so she can get back into the hive to get Newt, using her homing bracelet to track her. When Ripley locates the bracelet, however, she finds it on the floor and Newt is nowhere to be seen. Suddenly, Newt, who has been cocooned nearby, sees an Alien egg opening and a Facehugger about to leap out at her, so she screams. Ripley finds her, kills the Facehugger and releases Newt from the cocoon, and they start running back to the surface. Along the way, she takes a wrong turn, and they suddenly find themselves in a lair, facing the egg-laying Alien Queen. As she and Newt slowly back away, _Aliens_ (qv) close in around them. The Queen 'orders' the _Aliens_ (qv) to back away when Ripley threatens to destroy her eggs. Ripley finally empties her flame-thrower and automatic rifle on the Queen, the _Aliens_ (qv) and the eggs, and tosses in her arsenal of grenades, destroying the Queen's means of laying them. However, the Queen herself survives and chases after Ripley and Newt as they head back up through the complex to the platform, only to find that the dropship is no longer there. Just as a second elevator door opens and the Queen comes out, the dropship appears and picks them up. They head back to the Sulaco, and the complex blows up. As they're disembarking from the dropship onto the deck of the Sulaco, Bishop explains that the platform was becoming too unstable, forcing him to take to the air and to hover while waiting for them. Suddenly, Bishop is pierced through the chest by a large tail and then ripped in half. The Queen emerges from the landing gear of the dropship where she managed to stow away as the dropship was leaving the colony. Newt takes cover under the floor grates, while Ripley tries to divert the Queen by running into the cargo hold and closing the heavy steel door. The Queen then goes after Newt, but Ripley emerges from the hold in one of the mechanical cargo power-loaders that makes her more of a match in size and strength for the Queen. The two \"mothers\" fight each other, with Ripley eventually able to trap the Queen in an airlock and blow her into space. In the final scene, Bishop and Hicks have been placed in hypersleep, and Newt and Ripley do likewise for the return trip to Earth."], ["If the Alien can transform people into eggs (per the Alien Director's Cut), how does the egg-laying Queen fit in?", "The introduction of the Queen to the Alien franchise has caused considerable debate among viewers attempting to build consistent canon between the first two movies. Ridley Scott, director of the first movie, has stated that he considers the original cut of Alien to be the definitive version -- no queen and the scene in which Ripley stumbles upon Brett and Dallas being transformed into eggs having been cut from the movie. The transformation scene resurfaced in the Director's cut released in 2003, but by that time James Cameron had free reign from the studio to come up with his own alien life cycle for the second movie which was released in 1986 (as described in the commentary for _Aliens_ (qv): The Special Edition). A popular hypothesis among fans is that the _Aliens_ (qv) have a hive-based society. With insects, there is no \"Queen\" egg until the workers choose to create one. It could be that the lack of a Queen compels the Alien warriors to create the right circumstances for the production of a Queen, and that the \"transforming\" is part of preparing a host or producing the correct food source to make a \"Queen facehugger\". In this case, transforming humans is a behavior the Alien falls into if a queen isn't available to make eggs. Another theory is that the Alien doesn't turn people into eggs at all; the cocoons simply appear egg-shaped, but it takes a Queen to lay the eggs containing the Facehuggers."], ["If an alien Queen is necessary for reproduction, how did all those eggs get onto the derelect ship in \"Alien\"?", "There are many theories about how the eggs got aboard the derelict. The nature of the derelict and its crew are a mystery, left intentionally unanswered by the original crew that produced Alien. Viewers have proposed various theories, such as:\n\nTheory One: The Queen burst from the derelict's pilot. He may have been the only crew member on the ship, so once he died, the ship crashed, leaving the Queen time to lay thousands of eggs, then hibernate, until visitors came.\n\nTheory Two: The Space Jockey was some sort of scientist. He investigated a planet and found the eggs, loaded them onto his ship to examine, and was then impregnated by one. When he came to, not knowing what had happened to him, he took off into space. The alien then birthed, and he crashed with all the eggs intact (no queen present).\n\nTheory Three: Ignoring the continuity with the franchise and speculating on the original idea behind the aliens: the ship had a large crew, who were turned into eggs (as per a theory stemming from the director's cut). This would also mean that Lambert's comment \"I wonder what happened to the rest of the crew,\" was a subtle hint this was the original intention. If this is what happened then, there was never supposed to be a queen, and the Alien itself was the final stage. This theory is extremely unlikely, as the Space Jockey and its species are far too big to turn into little eggs. Not to mention; if everyone is turned into eggs, then who is left to impregnate?\n\nTheory Four: The Queen was on the ship, laid the eggs, but died off or was killed in the crash. It said that the Space Jockey had been dead for so long it had become fossilized, suggesting the ship had been there for thousands and thousands of years. (It's suggested the _Aliens_ (qv) don't age or die naturally from both the fact that the eggs survived in the ship for all that time and the fact that Ash says \"I have confirmed that he's got an outer layer of protein polysaccharides. Has a funny habit of shedding his cells and replacing them with polarized silicon, which gives him a prolonged resistance to adverse environmental conditions.\"). So a new queen wasn't birthed until _Aliens_ (qv), possibly from Newt's father.\n\nTheory Five: Director Ridley Scott explained in interview that he envisioned the derelict as a sort of carrier for biological weapons; the eggs were intentional cargo, but naturally, something went wrong. This is certainly consistent with the Company's obsession with obtaining a specimen for their bio-weapons research. The 2012 film Prometheus which is a prequel to the Alien series, supports this: in it, Company researchers discover an old colony of the Space Jockey race (called Engineers now), where they keep a black liquid containing very small organisms with highly mutagenic properties. Infection with the liquid produces various results: some humans start to mutate into gruelling monstrosities; one of the female workers births a squid-like organism after having sex with her infected partner; the squid subsequently 'impregnates' one of the Engineers like a facehugger, which in turn causes an Alien-like creature to burst out from the Engineer. This may suggest that the Engineers experimented with the black liquid, and finally produced the Alien species, which they used as bio-weapons."], ["Why is this the only Alien movie filmed in 1.85:1 ratio and not 2.35:1?", "According to James Cameron on the _Aliens_ (qv) Special Edition DVD (2003) commentary, he'd previously had trouble getting visual effects right in the wider aspect ratio of 2.35:1 while working on the FX crew of Escape From New York (1981), and so for _Aliens_ (qv) opted for the narrower and easier 1.85:1 ratio.

In case of _Aliens_ (qv), American audiences in particular were were not expected to willingly sit through a science-fiction movie of 148 minutes, so the studio demanded several cuts to tighten the plot. James Cameron went to the cutting room again, and removed more than 15 minutes of footage. Most of this was character development of Ripley or background information about what had happened to Newt's parents. Some of the action got cut out, as well. The advantage of the Theatrical Version is that it is moves more fluidly. The Director's Cut, however, offers more depth and information. This is also the opinion of director James Cameron, who prefers the Director's Cut, (also called the \"Special Edition\"), believing it to be the better and more exciting version of the movie. Leading actress 'Sigourney Weaver' (qv) also made clear which version she preferred, threatening to never shoot another Alien film if the longer Director's Cut was not released. A detailed comparison between both versions can be found here.

Specifications and quantities information classified. - New American Dictionary (2016)\nThe glossary for the film included in the 1982 press-kit defines a replicant as: A genetically engineered creature composed entirely of organic substance. Animal replicants (animoids) were developed first for use as pets and beasts of burden after most real animals became extinct. Later, humanoid replicants were created for military purposes and for the exploration and colonization of space. The Tyrell Corp. recently introduced the Nexus 6, the supreme replicant -- much stronger and faster than, and virtually indistinguishable from, real human beings. Earth law forbids replicants on the planet, except in the huge industrial complex where they are created. The law does not consider replicants human and therefore accords them no rights nor protection.\nThe \"Nexus 6\" replicants are the most advanced kind yet built, and are nearly indistinguishable from humans (in one draft of the script, Bryant ('M. Emmet Walsh' (qv)) tells Deckard they did an autopsy on the Replicant that was killed trying to break into the Tyrell Corp, and didn't even know it was a Replicant until two hours into the procedure). Additionally, they are far stronger than, and can be just as intelligent as, their designers. Replicants differ from humans in one important factor: they lack empathy, which is how the Voight-Kampff machine is used to detect them (by measuring changes in air density and monitoring pupil dilation and blush response). Additionally, in _Blade Runner_ (qv), the Replicants' eyes glow (even those of an artificial owl), although 'Ridley Scott' (qv) has stressed that this is merely a cinematic technique, and the glow cannot be seen by the characters in the story, only by the audience.\n\nDue to their highly developed brains and the ability to reflect on their actions, Nexus 6 Replicants would - if given enough time - develop emotional responses (Roy and Pris are seen showing affection for one another, and Leon experiences feelings of nostalgia, causing him to collect photos). However, the manufacturers noticed that this also caused Replicants to suffer from emotional instability and eccentricities, because they were emotionally immature, with only a few years to experience a lifetime's worth of feelings. Therefore, a fail-safe mechanism was built into all the Nexus 6 -- a four year lifespan."], ["Why does Bryant call the Replicants Skinjobs?", "'Skinjob' is Bryant's derogatory slang for 'Replicant.' In the theatrical cuts, Deckard's narration includes a comment that \"In history books he's the kind of cop who used to call black men n***ers.\""], ["Is Deckard a replicant?", "This is far and away the most hotly debated topic concerning the film. In the 'Philip K. Dick' (qv) novel Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep? Deckard was not a replicant. He is even tested to make sure. Indeed, the idea that Deckard may be a replicant seems to go against Dick's intent; The purpose of this story as I saw it was that in his job of hunting and killing these replicants, Deckard becomes progressively dehumanized. At the same time, the replicants are being perceived as becoming more human. Finally, Deckard must question what he is doing, and really what is the essential difference between him and them? And, to take it one step further, who is he if there is no real difference? (quoted here). Thus the idea that Deckard is 'becoming' a replicant is a metaphorical one, not something to be taken literally. 'Hampton Fancher' (qv) agreed with Dick on this point and when asked this very question in an interview he stated unequivocally that Deckard was not a replicant. However, in a September 2007 interview with Wired magazine, the film's director, 'Ridley Scott' (qv), stated what he considers to be the official answer to the question; that Deckard is a replicant:\n\nWired: It was never on paper that Deckard is a replicant.\n\nScott: It was, actually. That's the whole point of Gaff, the guy who makes origami and leaves little matchstick figures around. He doesn't like Deckard, and we don't really know why. If you take for granted for a moment that, let's say, Deckard is a Nexus 7, he probably has an unknown life span and therefore is starting to get awfully human. Gaff, at the very end, leaves an origami, which is a piece of silver paper you might find in a cigarette packet, and it's a unicorn. Now, the unicorn in Deckard's daydream tells me that Deckard wouldn't normally talk about such a thing to anyone. If Gaff knew about that, it's Gaff's message to say, \"I've read your file, mate.\" That relates to Deckard's first speech to Rachael when he says, \"That's not your imagination, that's Tyrell's niece's daydream.\" And he describes a little spider on a bush outside the window. The spider is an implanted piece of imagination. And therefore Deckard, too, has imagination and even history.\n\nRead the complete interview here.\n\nSimilarly, in '_Deck-A-Rep: The True Nature of Rick Deckard_ (qv)', Scott comments, \"I want to see what's inside his head, so it better be something extraordinary. So he's a romantic, because he's thinking about this unicorn. So that at the end of the film, I can have something absolutely remarkable, which I can illustrate, which is the unicorn, and he goes like that, 'Boom.' How would anyone have known what was inside his head other than someone who knew what was in his file, that had been implanted in his brain? Can't be any clearer than that. If you don't get it, you're a moron.\"\n\nActor 'Harrison Ford' (qv) however considers Deckard to be human. \"That was the main area of contention between Ridley and myself at the time,\" Ford told interviewer Jonathan Ross during a BBC1 Hollywood Greats segment. \"I thought the audience deserved one human being on screen that they could establish an emotional relationship with. I thought I had won Ridley's agreement to that, but in fact I think he had a little reservation about that. I think he really wanted to have it both ways.\"\n\nA number of the other filmmakers have also commented on this issue.\n\nAssociate producer 'Ivor Powell' (qv): \"Ridley wanted Deckard to have an unusual daydream while he was sitting at his piano. Something like a very private thought. One that Gaff would later know without being told. Which was meant to suggest that Deckard was a replicant. Which in turn explains the significance of Gaff leaving a tinfoil unicorn for Deckard to find at the end of the picture\" (Future Noir, 357).\n\nProducer 'Michael Deeley' (qv): \"I never thought Deckard was a replicant. That was just a bullshit, an extra layer Ridley put in. Also an obfuscation. Not only did I never believe Deckard was a replicant, I also thought it was futile to try and make him one. That was Ridley's theory, even if it didn't make any sense. Why would you do that? Deckard would be the first replicant you'd knock off if you were getting rid of them. Anyway, just because you say, 'Wouldn't it be funny if Deckard was a replicant?' doesn't necessarily make it so\" (Future Noir, 362).\n\nSupervising editor 'Terry Rawlings' (qv): \"Ridley never wanted to bring out a troupe of dancing bears holding up neon signs reading, 'Deckard is a replicant!' Instead, he was going for something more ambiguous. Ridley himself may have definitely felt that Deckard was a replicant, but still, by the end of the picture, he intended to leave it up to the viewer to decide whether Deckard was one \" (Future Noir, 363-364).\n\n'Terry Rawlings' (qv): \"I often get asked if Deckard is a replicant, and I think that you've got to make up your own mind. That's what's intended with the film. It's your choice\" (Deck-A-Rep').\n\nFuture Noir author 'Paul Sammon' (qv): \"When people ask me, 'he is a replicant, isn't he?' to my way of thinking, the only correct and proper answer is \"Maybe\"\" ('Deck-A-Rep').\n\nSome of the standard arguments put forward suggesting that Deckard is indeed a replicant include:\n\n- Gaff seems to follow Deckard everywhere - he is at the scene of Zhora and Roy's retirement almost immediately, and he is always with Bryant when Bryant is speaking to Deckard. The argument is that Gaff is the real blade runner, and that he is monitoring Deckard as he carries out his assignment. If Deckard is a Nexus 7, then Gaff could be observing Deckard as an experimental subject.\n\n- In the scene in his bathroom, when Rachael asks Deckard if he would follow her if she left, he says he wouldn't and then leaves the room, but he stops, puts his hand on her shoulder and says \"But someone would.\" When he says this, Deckard's eyes have a red glow, the same effect seen in the other replicants' eyes and in Tyrell's owl. In relation to this scene, 'Ridley Scott' (qv) maintains that that effect was purposely set up and executed on the set, but 'Harrison Ford' (qv) denies this, saying it was unintended. In an interview with 'Paul Sammon' (qv) in 2007, Ford comments simply \"I might have strayed into her light\" (Future Noir, 565 - 2nd Edition).\n\n- Although Deckard appears weak in comparison to Roy and Leon, he survives his beatings remarkably well. After being thrown around by Leon and slammed through a car windscreen; the only injury he seems to have is some blood in his mouth, his upper torso is unmarked. The argument here is that although Deckard doesn't have the superior strength of most replicants, he does have their ability to endure punishment.\n\n- Replicants have a penchant for photographs, because it gives them a tie to their non-existent past (we see this in relation to both Leon and Rachael). Deckard's flat is packed with photos, and none of them are recent or in color.\n\n- Some fans argue that when Roy reaches out and grabs Deckard, you can hear him say \"kinship.\" Rutger Hauer has rubbished this suggestion, however.\n\n- Gaff tells Deckard \"You've done a man's job, sir!\" Early drafts of the script have him then add: \"But are you sure you are a man? It's hard to be sure who's who around here.\"\n\n- A tentative claim which argues that Deckard is not a replicant is that all the replicants are called by their first names (Zhora, Pris, Roy, Leon and Rachael), but all the humans are called by their surnames (Holden, Bryant, Gaff, Chew, Tyrell, Sebastian). Deckard is also called by his surname throughout the film."], ["Why did Holden need to give Leon the VK test if the police already knew what he looked like and what his name was?", "In Future Noir, actor Brion James suggests that perhaps the files on which replicants had escaped to earth had not arrived at the police station by the time Holden was conducting his tests (120).

See here for more information on the Derringer and here for more information on the weaponry used throughout the film."], ["How did Leon smuggle his gun into the VK test? And how did he escape from the building, given that the whole incident was on videotape, and occurred on an upper floor?", "The 110-story New York  World Trade Center that made headlines when it was bombed in February 1993 and again when it was hit by two hijacked planes in 2001 housed roughly 50,000 workers, with around 200,000 people per day passing through as visitors. According to Future Noir, the Tyrell pyramid is 700-900 stories high, reaching over a mile into the sky (236). Since the top of the pyramid is apparently several times larger than the footprint of the WTC, the base is considerably larger. Additionally, it is surrounded by four buttresses, each of which must be greater in volume than the WTC. From this, we can speculate that Tyrell's pyramid must be larger than the WTC by a factor of 100 or more, and as such, it could house somewhere in the region of 5-10 million people. It would be easy to get lost in a crowd that size; after Leon shoots Holden, he would only need to mingle amongst the masses to reach the exit as finding him in this throng would an impossible task. As for how he got the weapon into the building in the first place, we know that the Tyrell Corp. security is not perfect because, 1) Bryant tells Deckard two replicants got fried on an electrical fence or other type of barrier trying to break in but the others got away, and 2) Roy gets in and kills Tyrell ('Joe Turkel' (qv)) with relative ease, using Sebastian's security clearance. Taking all of this together, it would not have been impossible for Leon to smuggle a weapon into the building, shoot Holden, and escape."], ["What does the voice from the blimp say?", "Workprint: \"A new life awaits you in the Off-World colonies.

Since we know that Deckard had been retired from the job for an undisclosed amount of time, he might not be familiar with the newer model Replicants and required a catch-up briefing."], ["Why can't Tyrell afford a real owl?", "In the shooting script (dated February 3, 1981), when Deckard asks Rachael if the bird is artificial, she says \"Of course not.\" This is how the scene was shot, with actress Sean Young saying \"Of course not.\" However, in the finished film, we hear her say \"Of course it is.\" According to producer 'Michael Deeley' (qv), \"Sean's line was changed in order to add credibility to the idea that Tyrell could manufacture perfect imitations of living things\" (Future Noir, 126). However, in the book Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?, Rachel lies to Deckard telling him it is indeed a real owl. The owl however, is fake. Owls were one of the first species to die out after the world war that devastated the planet years earlier. The Tyrell corporation would then create fake animals so that people can buy them and pass them off as real animals in order to heighten their social status. In the book, live animals are highly priced possessions, and the rarer the better. It is also considered a moral crime not to take care of and protect an animal. If you cannot afford a live animal, or the live animal you want is extinct, then a fake one is a good alternative."], ["What type of gun does Deckard use?", "The gun that Deckard uses is an Austrian Steyr-Mannlicher .222 Model SL bolt-action rifle, with the stock and barrel removed, leaving just the receiver. A Charter Arms .44 Special Police Bulldog was attached underneath, and a translucent pistol grip was added to the Bulldog for effect. Two LED lights were also added, as was a cockable hammer, and the entire weapon was painted flat matte black. The twin trigger seen on the gun is actually a feature of the real Steyr rifle, which has a distinctive bolt-handle and trigger-guard. See here for more information on the Steyr-Mannlicher and here for more information on the weaponry used throughout the film."], ["Who is the guy with his head on his arm in the photo from Leon's apartment?", "Roy Batty.

Obviously, the nearby police were unaware of what was transpiring in the alley. The Los Angeles depicted in the film is quite obviously an overcrowded metropolis and such incidents would easily go unnoticed."], ["What is the significance of the chess game?", "It has long been rumored that the chess game between Tyrell and Sebastian ('William Sanderson' (qv)) uses the conclusion of a game played between Adolf Anderssen and Lionel Kieseritzky in London in 1851. It is considered one of the most brilliant games ever played, largely due to Anderssen boldly sacrificing his Queen to secure checkmate (which is also how Sebastian beats Tyrell). The game is universally known as \"The Immortal Game.\" If the filmmakers did indeed use the Immortal Game as inspiration, the concept of immortality has obvious associations in the ensuing confrontation between Tyrell and Roy. On one level, the chess games represents the struggle of the Replicants against the humans: the humans consider the Replicants pawns, to be removed one by one. The individual Replicants (pawns) are attempting to become immortal (a queen). At another level, the game between Tyrell and Sebastian represents Roy stalking Tyrell. Tyrell makes a fatal mistake in the chess game, and another fatal mistake trying to reason with Roy. However, that the Immortal Game was specifically used in the film is open to doubt. Firstly, the chess boards in the film are not arranged exactly as they would be in The Immortal Game. Secondly, Sebastian's board does not match Tyrell's. Thirdly, in an interview published in Future Noir, 'Ridley Scott' (qv) dismisses the rumor as incorrect, saying any similarity between the Immortal Game and the Sebastian/Tyrell game was purely coincidental (384 -1st edition; 490 - 2nd edition)."], ["Why are real animals so expensive if there are lots of birds living in Sebastian's building?", "The novel Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep? offers an explanation. Some animals are considerably rarer than others, and apparently, while there are no owls left, pigeons remained plentiful."], ["What happened to Sebastian?", "After Roy kills Tyrell, Sebastian is not seen again. However, what happened to him is explained clearly by the film; as Deckard gets a radio call while in his vehicle, we hear that two bodies have been found at the Tyrell Corp. building, one of which is that of J.F. Sebastian."], ["Batty calls Deckard by name during the chase at the end. How did he know Deckard's name?", "There are several theories on this subject, but it is most likely simply a technical error in the film. One such theory is suggested by some of the different versions of the script, which have Deckard as a well-known _Blade Runner_ (qv). Another theory is that Leon was within earshot when Deckard showed his ID to a policeman after killing Zhora, and Leon tells Roy Deckard's name before his confrontation with Deckard. Another possibility is that Deckard may have left paperwork in Tyrell's office with his name on it, and after killing Tyrell, Roy could have gone through his papers and found Deckard's name.\n\nThe problem with all of these theories however is that no concrete evidence for any of them is supplied by the film itself. A less speculative explanation, however, insofar as it is found in 'Hampton Fancher' (qv)'s script dated 7 January 1980, is that Bryant reveals the replicants may have tapped into the ESPER computer that it will take about a day to secure the system. Later, at Sebastian's apartment, Batty tells Pris and (a replicant dropped from the film very late in the scripting stage) Mary that Leon and Zhora are dead and that the police have discovered he has been tapping into computer, hence they can no longer can't monitor what the police doing. This is what prompts Pris to say \"Then we're stupid and die,\" and why the replicants are expecting Deckard to come for them."], ["What is the significance of the nail which Roy drives through his hand?", "On a practical level, Roy is dying, and as a result, his hand was seizing up. This is demonstrated by his clenched fist, and his inability to unclench it. He drives a nail through his palm to release the tendons holding his fist clenched, so he can regain the use of his hand. There is also an element of Christian symbolism here, specifically drawing parallels with Christ being nailed through the hands onto a cross."], ["What are the tattoos seen on Roy towards the end of the film?", "They are not tattoos. As 'Ridley Scott' (qv) explains, That was a half-developed idea that we never really cracked. You see, I've always liked what 'Jean Giraud' (qv), the French artist and illustrator, does. His characters almost seem to be built up from various plastic parts, with odd divisions in their flesh. I couldn't do that to Rutger though; the daily makeup process would have been impossible. So we experimented with some tattooing that was supposed to suggest something like demarcations in an engine. The idea really was that they indicated an alignment to certain socket points. I'd thought that when Roy was in battle in outer space, he'd probably put on a war suit and attach plugs to that suit at those markings. But it kind of dropped away, the whole idea, and never really worked (Future Noir, 188)."], ["Why does Roy save Deckard?", "There is much disagreement amongst both fans and filmmakers as to exactly why Roy saves Deckard's life at the end of the film. For example, according to 'Ridley Scott' (qv), It was an endorsement in a way, that the character is almost more human than human, in that he can demonstrate a very human quality at a time when the roles are reversed and Deckard may have been delighted to blow his head off. But Roy takes the humane route. But also, in a way, because Roy wants a kind of death watch, where he knows he is going, dying. So in a sense, he is saving Deckard for something, to pass on the information that what the makers are doing is wrong - either the answer is not to make them at all, or deal with them as human beings (Future Noir, 193).\nAccording to Rutger Hauer, however, there is an altogether more mundane reason behind Roy's actions; Ridley insisted that one thing Batty had to have was absolutely no sense of hesitation. He doesn't reflect, he reacts. He's faster than anybody. A characteristic of the Nexus 6. So, if you follow that thought, you reach a point where you realize that if somebody falls, Batty grabs. It has nothing to do with how he feels about Deckard, it's just a reactive moment. That's what Roy's built for. In fact, while we were shooting this moment, we had a problem with the rain machines and had to wait around for them to be fixed. And I actually asked, \"Ridley, what do you think? Why does Roy save this fucker?\" And Ridley looked at me and said, \"It's purely a reflex. Other than that, I don't know.\" This response might bother some people, because so many folks have read a lot of meaning into Batty saving Deckard's life. But actions always come first. Then we think about them. Roy doesn't know why he saves Deckard or grabs a dove. He just does it (Future Noir, 194).\nOf course, it is very well possible that the actual grasping and saving are two separate actions by Roy. Throughout the film, Roy has shown that he has no problem with killing. Even if Roy grasped Deckard in a reflex, if he really wanted him dead, he could just have released him and let him fall to his death. Holding on to Deckard and even hoisting him up to safety therefore feels like a deliberate act, and Roy may even be conflicted about his reasons for doing it himself.\n\nIn the theatrical cut, the scene is followed by a narrative voiceover by Deckard: I don't know why he saved my life. Maybe in those last moments he loved life more than he ever had before. Not just his life - anybody's life; my life. All he'd wanted were the same answers the rest of us want. Where did I come from? Where am I going? How long have I got? All I could do was sit there and watch him die."], ["What is the Tannhauser Gate?", "Given the fact that Earth has off-world colonies in _Blade Runner_ (qv), and the typical functions of devices incorporating the word \"gate\" in science fiction, fans of the film have suggested that the Tannhauser Gate may be a stargate or similar construct. They speculate that as a stargate, it would provide faster-than-light travel between star systems. Given its name, it would perhaps be located near or in orbit of a colony named Tannhauser.\n\nIn the 1998 film _Soldier_ (qv), which is an unofficial 'sidequel' of _Blade Runner_ (qv), Sgt. Todd (played by 'Kurt Russell' (qv)) is a veteran of the Battle at the Tannhauser Gate. This fact is based on the text displayed momentarily on a computer screen near the beginning of the film. The screen displays a list of battles that the character has fought in, and the awards that he has earned in these battles. Tannhauser Gate is also tattooed on Todd's arm, along with the other battles of which he was a veteran. Later in the film, when Sandra ('Connie Nielsen' (qv)) notices the names tattooed on his arm, Mace ('Sean Pertwee' (qv)) explains that \"Tannhauser Gate was a battle.\" The original script was to have the film actually depict the battle. However, this idea was cut for budgetary reasons."], ["Batty's incept date is January 2016, so he should have lived until January 2020. Why does he die in November 2019?", "The film opens with \"Los Angeles November 2019\".This is offered, as some films do, to establish a starting point to the story. It does not mean that all of the events in the story take place in November 2019, only that this is where the story begins. As there is no clearly demarcated time-frame in the film, there is no sure way of knowing how much time passes between the beginning and the end. Roy's incept date is \"January 8, 2016\". His \"four year lifespan\" would thus have him expiring on January 8, 2020. If the film begins in November 2019, for it to end on January 8, 2020, it would have to take place over a period of 40 to 69 days. As this is not an unreasonable amount of time for the story's events to happen, perhaps Roy dies exactly when he is supposed to."], ["What is the significance of the dove Roy releases after his death?", "Accounts in both the book Future Noir and the _Dangerous Days: Making Blade Runner_ (qv) (2007) documentary on the Final Cut DVD indicate that the dove was an idea improvised by Rutger Hauer on the day of shooting. Hauer confirms it in his own autobiography All Those Moments, saying it served as a replacement for a page-long piece of monologue they had intended for him. For Hauer, the dove flying away symbolized Batty's death, with his soul escaping and flying into freedom: There's a lot of symbolism there. And I don't mean Christian ones. The dove could represent Batty's soul, freedom, wings, a liberation from a certain lifestyle, all that. There's a lot of interesting connections to birds in mythologies and religions other than Christianity (Future Noir, 192)."], ["How did Gaff get Deckard's gun? Was he following Deckard and Roy?", "Possibly. Another hypothesis is that Deckard sits on the roof for a considerable amount of time. In the Workprint, Deckard says he watched Batty die all night and that it was a slow, painful thing. In this case, Gaff would have had plenty of time to make his way to the Bradbury building and find the gun."], ["What is the significance of the unicorn?", "When Deckard leaves his apartment with Rachael at the end of the film, she knocks over an origami unicorn. The unicorn is the last in a series of origami figures that Gaff uses to taunt Deckard. In Bryant's office when Deckard insists he's retired, Gaff folds a chicken (implying that Deckard is afraid to hunt the replicants). Later he makes a man with an erection (implying that Deckard is getting excited about being a _Blade Runner_ (qv) again). Finally, he makes the unicorn (implying that Deckard is dreaming about running away with Rachael when he knows she won't live; this reiterates what he said to Deckard on the rooftop, which is why his rooftop line occurs here as voiceover). Looking at the unicorn in this sense, it is simply a message to Deckard to say \"I know you've got Rachael, I'll let her live because she's going to die soon anyway.\" In terms of metaphorical significance, unicorns were doomed not to survive the Flood, and Gaff may think the same of Rachael, as she too has a predetermined lifespan.\n\nThe unicorn may also symbolize: (1) Rachael is (and always will be) a replicant among humans, and will be different, like a unicorn among horses. (2) Rachael leaving and knocking over the unicorn symbolizes her escape from the Tyrell corporation, which only looked upon her as a replicant. Deckard fell in love with her as a human, and by doing so, she became human. (3) \"The silver unicorn [...] is a made thing, a piece of human handiwork, beautiful and fragile and glittering, yet perceived as waste, thrown down and trodden upon, easily destroyed. Also, it is in the form of an animal, albeit a mythical one, and in the BR future, the beasts of the earth and fowls of the air are all but extinct, except in replicant form\" (Rebecca Warner, Retrofitting _Blade Runner_ (qv)).\n\nThe Director's Cut and Final Cut, however, complicate the issue of the unicorn, as both include a scene not in the original release or the Workprint. As Deckard sits at his piano, we see a shot of a unicorn running through a forest (in the Director's Cut, it is implied that Deckard is dozing and dreaming, but in the Final Cut it is clear that he is wide awake and simply thinking to himself). Taking this into account, the standard argument is that Gaff knew that Deckard had visions of a unicorn. If Gaff knew what Deckard was thinking, then we can assume that Deckard is a replicant, and Gaff knew he would be thinking of a unicorn just the way Deckard knew about the spider outside Rachael's window (as Deckard had seen Rachael's files, so too had Gaff seen Deckard's). 'Ridley Scott' (qv) had intended the unicorn scene to be in the 1982 theatrical release, but the producers vetoed the idea as \"too arty.\"\n\nIn the November, 1982 edition of Starburst magazine (no. 51), in an article entitled \"The Blade Cuts,\" 'Ridley Scott' (qv) mentions this scene:'Ridley Scott' (qv): Did you see the version [of the script] with the unicorn?\n\nAlan McKenzie: No.\n\nS: I think the idea of the unicorn was a terrific idea.\n\nM: The obvious inference is that Deckard is a replicant himself.\n\nS: Sure. To me it's entirely logical, particularly when you are doing a film noir, you may as well go right through with that theme, and the central character could in fact be what he is chasing.\n\nM: Did you actually shoot the sequence in the glade with the unicorn?\n\nS: Absolutely. It was cut into the picture, and I think it worked wonderfully. Deckard was sitting, playing the piano rather badly because he was drunk, and there's a moment where he gets absorbed and goes off a little at a tangent and we went into the shot of the unicorn plunging out of the forest. It's not subliminal, but it's a brief shot. Cut back to Deckard and there's absolutely no reaction to that, and he just carries on with the scene. That's where the whole idea of the character of Gaff with his origami figures -- the chicken and the little stick-figure man, so the origami figure of the unicorn tells you that Gaff has been there. One of the layers of the film has been talking about private thoughts and memories, so how would Gaff have known that a private thought of Deckard was of a unicorn? That's why Deckard shook his head like that [referring to Deckard nodding his head after picking up the paper unicorn] (from p.29)."], ["I've heard eyes are important in the film. Why is this?", "Eye symbolism is prevalent throughout the film. For example, the all-seeing Orwellian eye in the opening sequence; the motif of replicants' glowing eyes; the owl's large eyes; Tyrell has huge trifocal glasses that emphasize that feature of his face; eyes are important in the VK test; Rachael: \"I wanted to see you\"; Rachael: \"He wouldn't see me\"; Chew's Eye World, with a mockup of an eye above the door; Chew: \"Eyes, eyes...I do only eyes\"; Roy: \"If only you could see what I've seen with your eyes!\"; Roy: \"Not an easy man to see, I guess\"; Leon tries to stick his fingers in Deckard's eyes; Roy plays with the glass-encased eyes in Sebastian's apartment; Roy sticks his thumbs in Tyrell's eyes; Pris rolls her eyes back in her head to show only the whites; Roy: \"I've seen things you people wouldn't believe.\" The movie ends in 2020; an allusion to 20/20 vision. As to the significance of this proliferation, in literature, art and esotericism, the human eye is often considered the window to one's soul, thus the use of the eye-symbol in _Blade Runner_ (qv) could be interpreted as a key to the question of whether or not replicants have souls."], ["I've heard the film has a lot of religious connotations. What are they?", "The replicants are often seen as fallen angels (fallen from the heavens/outer space), with Roy as Lucifer. When Roy and Leon enter Chew's, Roy says, \"Fiery the angels fell, Deep thunder roll'd around their shores, Burning with the fires of Orc.\" This is a paraphrase of 'William Blake' (qv)'s epic poem, America: A Prophesy, where the real line reads \"Fiery the angels rose, and as they rose deep thunder roll'd/Around their shores: indignant burning with the fires of Orc.\" The change of the first line from \"rose\" to \"fell\" is obviously important; the replicants are the fiery angels who have fallen. Tyrell is their creator, hence their god. However, he purposely creates imperfect beings, giving them only a four year lifespan. Roy resents the in-built imperfection (since the creator had no reason apart from fear to inhibit his creations), and he returns to the creator to fix him. He uses an elevator to get to Tyrell's level as if he is ascending towards heaven to meet his maker. The journey to find God is a common motif in many religions, not just Christianity; as Roy says \"It's not an easy thing to meet one's maker.\" However when the creator cannot fix him, he kills the creator (ie he kills his god). This has connotations beyond the film, alluding to the notion of what a person would do/say if he/she could actually speak to God. If Roy can condemn his creator for determining his life span to be only four years, can not we also condemn our Creator for placing us under a death sentence at birth? Can we sit in judgment of God as Roy sits in judgment of Tyrell?\n\nOther interesting religious references are to be found in the fact that Tyrell lives in a giant pyramid (like a Pharaoh), which looks like a cathedral inside and his huge pedestaled and canopied bed, is modeled after the bed of 'Pope John Paul II' (qv). There is also the scene where Roy puts a nail through his palm, a symbol of Christian crucifixion, and releases the dove, a symbol for the freeing of his soul, as explained above. Of course, this posits Roy as both Lucifer (the leader of the fallen angels) and Christ (the nail through his palm). On a theological level, the \"felix culpa,\" or \"fortunate fall\" through which one is redeemed, is occasioned by Satan. In the film, Deckard's \"fortunate fall\" is occasioned by Roy, who saves him from plummeting to his death and imparts a new outlook on life in his dying moments. Finally, some fans argue that Roy is based upon the title character of the Epic of Gilgamesh, who is \u00be God, \u00bc man. Both Roy and Gilgamesh kill innocent people; both have an unintelligent but extremely dangerous lieutenant who dies half way through the story; both quest for more life; both meet their creator; both fail in their quest for more life; both are redeemed in the moment of their deaths."], ["Why were the voice-over and happy ending added?", "'Ridley Scott' (qv) made _Blade Runner_ (qv) in a style called \"film noir.\" Film noir is a \"hardboiled detective\" style of story-telling, perhaps the most famous example of which is the 'John Huston' (qv) movie _The Maltese Falcon_ (qv) starring 'Humphrey Bogart' (qv). A trademark of the film noir genre is a voice-over by the protagonist, explaining what he is thinking/doing at any given time.\n\nIt is often claimed that 'Ridley Scott' (qv) never wanted the film to have any kind of voice-over whatsoever, but this is inaccurate. As he himself explains on his DVD commentary track, he was quite open to the idea of a voiceover (there is a brief voice-over towards the end of the Workprint). Indeed, according to 'Hampton Fancher' (qv), the idea of a voice-over first originated with Scott himself: \"Ridley was the one who initially pushed the voice-over idea. That's why it's in so many of my drafts. Scott was after the feel of a forties' detective thriller, so he liked the idea of using this film noir device\" (Future Noir, 292). Scott himself confirms this in _Dangerous Days: Making Blade Runner_ (qv); \"It wasn't ['Perenchio' (qv) and 'Yorkin's' (qv)] idea, it was our idea. I'm not stupid; I looked at the results and I saw this ain't working. I agree with [them]. 'What can we do; how about voiceover'?\" 'Harrison Ford' (qv), however, was dead set against a voiceover from the very start of the film.\n\nConflict arose, however, in relation to the content of the voiceover. Scott felt a voiceover musing philosophically on the events unfolding could work, but he was totally against the idea of an expositionary voiceover which explained things to the audience as the film progressed. After the disastrous Workprint preview screenings, where an overriding complaint was that the film was difficult to follow, executive producers Jerry 'Perenchio' (qv) and Bud Yorkin decided they needed clear up the confusion. As such, they were primarily responsible for the inclusion of the original voice-over heard in the 1982 theatrical release, which was exactly the type of voice-over that Scott had wanted to avoid. This version of the voice-over was recorded without the presence or approval of Scott, which is where the notion comes from that he was forced to add it against his will.\n\nThe LA Times further clarifies the situation: (A)n extensive voice-over was added to help people relate to 'Harrison Ford' (qv)'s character and make following the plot easier. [A]fter a draft by novelist-screenwriter 'Darryl Ponicsan' (qv) was discarded, a TV veteran named 'Roland Kibbee' (qv) got the job. As finally written, the voice-over met with universal scorn from the filmmakers, mostly for what Scott characterized as its 'Irving the Explainer' quality [...] It sounded so tinny and ersatz that, in a curious bit of film folklore, many members of the team believe to this day that 'Harrison Ford' (qv), consciously or not, did an uninspired reading of it in the hopes it wouldn't be used. And when co-writers Fancher and Peoples, now friends, saw it together, they were so afraid the other had written it that they refrained from any negative comments until months later. (Los Angeles Times, 13 September, 1992).\nRegarding the happy ending of the original theatrical release, this too was included at the behest of 'Perenchio' (qv) and Yorkin. Again, however, there is a great deal of inaccurate information about 'Ridley Scott' (qv)'s resistance to the idea. The common assumption is that Scott wanted the film to end with Deckard and Rachael getting into the elevator, but the studio (Tandem Productions) decided that the film needed a happier, less ambiguous ending. This is not entirely accurate. Initially, during preproduction, 'Ridley Scott' (qv) had proposed a similar ending himself, to be shot near the end of the schedule. However, he changed his mind during production and the scene was scrapped. After the disastrous Denver/Dallas sneak previews, where people said they disliked the abruptness of the ending, Scott quite willingly added the much maligned happy ending - he was not forced to do it by Tandem. And although his preferred ending was the elevator doors slamming, he had no problem adding the additional material. 'Ivor Powell' (qv), 'Michael Deeley' (qv) and Scott himself all attest to this in Future Noir (300-302). Additionally, in the Dangerous Days DVD documentary, Scott comments, \"I did it because I figured it might actually affect what I thought the outcome of the movie would be negative [sic], so I better deal with it .\"\n\nAfter the San Diego sneak (which included the voiceover and happy ending) scored higher than the Denver/Dallas sneak (which did not), Scott became convinced that the voiceover and ending had been necessary all along. Ironically, when the film was released theatrically, the two aspects most derided by critics would be the voiceover and the happy ending. In September 1992, Warner Bros. released \"The Director's Cut\" of _Blade Runner_ (qv), which eliminated the voice-overs and the happy ending. For the December 2007 Final Cut, these omissions remained."], ["What are the differences between the book and the film?", "There are many differences between the film and the book.

RCA, which at one time was the leading consumer electronics and communications conglomerate in the world, was bought out by one time parent GE in 1985, and dismantled. Also in 1985, Coca-Cola released their \"new formula,\" resulting in losses of millions of dollars. Atari, which had 70% of the home video game market when the film came out, never recovered from the next year's downturn in the industry, and by the 1990s had ceased to exist as anything more than a brand.

Additionally, Bryant says two replicants died in the attempted break in at the Tyrell building and Roy says \"I want more life, father.\" This is the version of the film which was shown at the Fairfax Theater in 1990 and UCLA's Los Angeles Perspectives multimedia festival in 1991, and later at the NuArt Theatre in LA and the Castro theatre in San Francisco, the success of which prompted Warner to release the 1992 Director's Cut.\n\nThe San Diego Sneak (May 8, Cinema 21 Theatre, San Diego) After the Denver/Dallas sneak received poor scores from the test audiences, the film returned to postproduction and a number of changes were made. The version screened in San Diego was identical to the theatrical release except for three small differences: 1) A full length shot of Roy in the Vidphone booth; 2) A shot of Deckard trying to reload after Roy has broken his fingers; 3) A high altitude shot of Deckard's car driving through the countryside. This version of the film had the theatrical voice-over, the theatrical happy ending and the removal of some of the more graphic violence.\n\nThe US Theatrical Cut: Identical to the San Diego sneak except for the three shots noted above.\n\nThe International Cut: Identical to the US theatrical cut except for four additional shots: 1) There is a close up of Roy inserting his thumbs into Tyrell's eyes and blood spurting out; 2) During the fight between Pris and Deckard, Pris lifts Deckard up by his nostrils; 3) Deckard shoots Pris three times instead of two; 4) When Roy pushes the nail through his hand, there is a close up of it coming out on the other side.\n\nThe Director's Cut: Similar to the theatrical cut except: 1) there is no voice-over whatsoever; 2) there is a short shot of a unicorn when Deckard is sitting by the piano; 3) there is no happy ending, the film ends as the elevator doors slam shut.\n\nThe Final Cut: 'Ridley Scott' (qv)'s definitive version of the film, with numerous aesthetic alterations, new shots and remixed sound. Quite similar to the Workprint.\n\nSee here for specific information about the various different versions of the film.\n\nA comparison with pictures between the Director's Cut and the older unrated Laser Disc can be found here.

Paul M. Sammon gives an exhaustive overview of the various albums in Appendix E of Future Noir (419-425 - 1st edition; 525-531 & 572-576 - 2nd edition), and whilst there is little point in reproducing his research in specific detail, a brief history of the soundtrack may prove interesting.\n\nIn June 1982, just weeks before the film was to be released, an album began circulating in LA entitled _Blade Runner_ (qv): Original Motion Picture Soundtrack. Running 60 minutes, this was a bootleg, with no company listed anywhere on the packaging or inlay card. At the time, the common wisdom was that an unknown disgruntled sound engineer working on the film recorded a dupe of the soundtrack prior to the final mix, and made copies. With rumors spreading that 'Vangelis' (qv)' score may never be released, the bootleg sold in great numbers despite having poor sound quality. It has since gone on to be a rare collector's item.\n\nThree weeks after the bootleg was released, Warner Brothers Records Inc. released an album entitled _Blade Runner_ (qv): Orchestral Adaptation of Music Composed for the Motion Picture by 'Vangelis' (qv). This is not the actual movie soundtrack, rather it is an orchestral arrangement of the soundtrack performed by the New American Orchestra. Running only 33 minutes, the album received extremely poor reviews upon its release, with Warner Brothers Records taking a lot of criticism for basically duping people into believing it was the official soundtrack. Additionally, reviews stated that the sound quality was extremely poor, and the actual performances of the music dull and heartless. According to 'Paul Sammon' (qv), \"This dismal, homogenized, rushed-into-production anomaly can only be recommended as Muzak for androids\" (420 - 1st edition; 526 - 2nd edition). This album is still readily available today. The track listing is as follows: (1) 'Love Theme', (2) 'Main Title' (3) 'One More Kiss, Dear', (4) 'Memories Of Green', (5) 'End Title', (6) '_Blade Runner_ (qv) Blues', (7) 'Farewell', (8) 'End Title Reprise'/\n\nIn September 1989, 'Vangelis' (qv) released an album entitled 'Vangelis' (qv): Themes. Essentially a collection of samples of his soundtrack work over the last few years, the album contained the following music from _Blade Runner_ (qv): 'End Titles', 'Love Theme', and 'Memories of Green'.\n\nIncidentally, \"Memories of Green\" had originally been released on the 1980 album See You Later, with 'Ridley Scott' (qv) using the orchestrated version in the film. The Japanese vocals associated with the Blimp Advertisement were taken from the 1976 album Japan: Traditional Vocal And Instrumental Music. The specific track is called 'Ogi no Mato' (The Folding Fan as a Target) and is performed by 'Ensemble Nipponia' (qv). 'Ogi no Mato' is part of a song cycle/epic somewhat reminiscent of Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet and the William Tell legend (as 'Ogi no Mato' features young people from opposing clans and a crucial moment of archery). Reportedly, the lyrics tell of the tragic and utter destruction of one Japanese clan by another. The music is produced with a Biwa - a traditional Japanese instrument.\n\nIn December 1993, a second bootleg album was released, this time by Off World Music Ltd, under the name Original Motion Picture Soundtrack: _Blade Runner_ (qv). Running 73 minutes, according to Sammon, this album has much better sound quality and is more extensive than the 1994 official soundtrack.\n\nIn July 1994, Warner Music released the official _Blade Runner_ (qv) soundtrack, entitled _Blade Runner_ (qv): 'Vangelis' (qv). Running 56 minutes, 'Vangelis' (qv)' notes accompanying the album say:\"Most of the music contained in this album originates from recordings I made in London in 1982, whilst working on the score for the film _Blade Runner_ (qv). Finding myself unable to release these recordings at the time, it is with great pleasure that I am able to do so now. Some of the pieces contained will be known to you from the Original Soundtrack of the film, whilst others are appearing here for the first time. Looking back at 'Ridley Scott' (qv)'s powerful and evocative pictures left me as stimulated as before, and made the recompiling of this music, today, an enjoyable experience.\" The track listing is as follows: (1) 'Main Titles', (2) 'Blush Response', (3) 'Wait for Me' (4) 'Rachel's Song', (5) 'Love Theme', (6) 'One More Kiss, Dear', (7) '_Blade Runner_ (qv) Blues', (8) 'Memories of Green', (9) 'Tales of the Future', (10) 'Damask Rose', (11) '_Blade Runner_ (qv) (End Titles) ', and (12) 'Tears in Rain'.\n\nIn 1995, a third bootleg CD went on the market, this time from Gongo Music. According to Sammon, like the 1993 Off-World Music CD, the Gongo Music album has excellent sound and a comprehensive track listing. Note that the liner notes and track titles are written in Romanian.\n\nBetween 1996 and 2007, at least 28 distinct bootleg versions of the soundtrack were released. Of this plethora of albums (which is summarized in the 2nd edition of Future Noir, 573-576), it is perhaps worth noting the following versions:\n\n1.\t_Blade Runner_ (qv): Special Edition, Deck Music, 1999. According to Sammon, this Japanese album has some of the best sound quality of all the bootlegs, and also features some cues not featured on any other album (including the 1994 official soundtrack). Only 100 copies were pressed however, making it ultra rare.\n\n2.\t_Blade Runner_ (qv): Definitive Edition, Off-World Music, 2000. A 3-CD set with good sound quality, it features every single piece of music from the film.\n\n3.\t_Blade Runner_ (qv): Deck Definitive Edition, Deck Art, 2001. A Japanese release, this is worth noting as it features an ultra rare alternate remix of 'Tears in Rain', composed by 'John Williams' (qv).\n\n4.\t_Blade Runner_ (qv): Esper Edition, Esper Productions, 2002. Sammon says that this bootleg also has exceptionally good sound quality, and is extensive in its coverage of the music. According to Sammon, either this or the Special Edition by Deck Music are the best available bootlegs.\n\n5.\t_Blade Runner_ (qv): Los Angeles, November 2019, Esper Productions, 2003. Features a combination of music from the film and the 1997 _Westwood game_ (qv).\n\n6.\t_Blade Runner_ (qv), _Cliffhanger_ (qv) and Radio Plays, No Company, 2003. The strangest of all the bootlegs, this CD features 13 cues from _Blade Runner_ (qv), the opening theme from _Cliffhanger_ (qv) (which was scored by 'Trevor Jones' (qv)), and 2 radio plays that bear absolutely no relationship whatsoever to the film or the music!\n\n7.\t_Blade Runner_ (qv): Esper Edition MK III, No Company, 2005. Nothing to do with the original Esper Edition, this CD is worth noting simply because it is a 4-CD set. Sammon however, says the sound quality is poor, and there is nothing on any of the CDs that cant be found elsewhere.\n\nIn December 2007, in conjunction with the 25th anniversary of the film and the DVD release of 'Ridley Scott' (qv)s definitive 'Final Cut', 'Vangelis' (qv) released a 3-CD album called _Blade Runner_ (qv) Trilogy: 25th Anniversary. The track listing is as follows:\n\nDisc 1 [this is the same as the 1994 Official _Blade Runner_ (qv) Soundtrack]:(1) 'Main Titles', (2) 'Blush Response', (3) 'Wait for Me', (4) 'Rachel's Song', (5) 'Love Theme', (6) 'One More Kiss, Dear', (7) '_Blade Runner_ (qv) Blues', (8) 'Memories of Green', (9) 'Tales of the Future', (10) 'Damask Rose', (11) '_Blade Runner_ (qv) (End Titles) ', and (12) 'Tears in Rain'. Disc 2 [contains previously unreleased cues and samples from the Workprint]: (1) 'Longing', (2) 'Unveiled Twinkling Space', (3) 'Dr. Tyrell's Owl', (4) 'At Mr. Chew's', (5) 'Leo's Room', (6) 'One Alone', (7) 'Deckard and Roy's Duel', (8) 'Dr. Tyrell's Death', (9) 'Desolation Path', (10) 'Empty Streets', (11) 'Mechanical Dolls', and (12) 'Fading Away' (3:32) Disc 3 [contains spoken word tracks from filmmakers, critics, musicians and public figures talking about the film]: (1) 'Launch Approval', (2) 'Up and Running' (3) 'Mail From India', (4) 'BR Downtown' (2:27 - 'Oliver Stone' (qv), Akiko Ebi, 'Cherry Vanilla' (qv)), (5) 'Dimitri's Bar', (6) 'Sweet Solitude', (7) 'No Expectation Boulevard', (8) 'Vadavarot', (9) 'Perfume Exotico', (10) 'Spotkanie Z Matka', (11) 'Piano in an Empty Room', and (12) 'Keep Asking'."], ["Where can I find out more about _Blade Runner_ (qv)?", "Both editions (1996 & 2007) of Paul M. Sammon's  Future Noir: The Making of _Blade Runner_ (qv) contain an excellent bibliography of both printed material (Appendix G) and online material (Appendix D - although most of the links Sammon gives here are no longer active). The 2nd Edition also contains additional online material (571).\n\nRetrofitting _Blade Runner_ (qv): Issues in 'Ridley Scott' (qv)'s _Blade Runner_ (qv) and 'Philip K.

Kerman and published by Bowling Green State University Popular Press in 1991, contains an extensive annotated bibliography by _Blade Runner_ (qv) expert William M. Kolb. This is generally considered the most exhaustive bibliography ever compiled on _Blade Runner_ (qv) (and is only a shortened version of Kolb's massive unpublished 150,000 word bibliography). Retrofitting _Blade Runner_ (qv) was republished in a 2nd Edition in 1997, and a number of new entries were added to the existing bibliography.\n\nA more up to date annotated bibliography can be found here.

The scenes which comprise this short version of the film are:\n\nTears in the Rain (Alternate Opening Titles): An alternate title sequence featuring huge water drops splashing onto the ground in slow motion, in time with the 'Vangelis' (qv) music.\n\nI'm Deckard: An alternate introduction to Deckard, featuring different angles of the blimp, the noodlebar and the scene where Gaff arrives. There is also a new voiceover here, with Deckard talking about his wife leaving him for a rich prospector on one of the colonies.\n\nA Real Dandy: An alternate version of the scene where Gaff and Deckard arrive at the police station, revealing more of Union Station. In the new voiceover, Deckard explains that Gaff is new to the job and hungry for promotion.\n\nBryant's Point of View: A truncated version of the scene where Deckard and Bryant watch the incept tapes. The voiceover here talks about how Bryant knows something about everyone.\n\nVisiting Holden: Deckard visits Holden in hospital. Holden tells Deckard how life like the new Nexus 6 model is, and they speculate as to whether the Voight-Kampff will work on them.\n\nRep Detect File: As Deckard and Gaff approach the Tyrell building, Deckard flips through a file on the four replicants and the voiceover explains the background of each one.\n\nZero-Zero-Zero: A alternate version of Rachael's Voight-Kampff test. The voiceover talks about how difficult it was to determine that she was a replicant, and expresses disgust at what Tyrell is doing.\n\n1187 Hunterwasser: An alternate version of Deckard and Gaff searching Leon's hotel room. More of the geography of the room is seen, and additionally, at the end of the scene, Leon is revealed to have been hiding somewhere in the bathroom the entire time the two policemen were present.\n\nChew's Specialty: An alternate introduction to Roy, who is shown in full profile standing in the phone booth. A voiceover explains who Chew is.\n\nHeading Home: An alternate version of the scene where Deckard arrives at his apartment block, showing him getting out of his car and running to escape the rain. The voiceover talks about how poorly the case is going.\n\nAn Oddball Genius: An alternate version of the meeting between Pris and Sebastian, showing a high angle shot from overhead as Pris approaches the Bradbury. The voiceover talks about how difficult being a _Blade Runner_ (qv) is, and why the replicants wanted to see Sebastian.\n\nMemories: A different version of the scene where Deckard uses the Esper. In this version, the graphics seen on the Esper screen look completely different to all other versions of the film. Additionally, when Deckard asks for a hardcopy, the print out matches the image on-screen. The voiceover here talks about how demoralizing the job is, and there is some more information on Deckard's ex-wife, who we see in a photograph.\n\nFood for Thought: A scene of Deckard sitting at the noodle bar eating. The man beside him gets fish, and Deckard suddenly realizes that maybe the scale he found belongs to a fish. The voiceover here basically just summarizes what is shown.\n\nThe Street of Bad Dreams: More footage of Deckard approaching Taffy Lewis' club, which reveals a lot more of the street. Also, an alternate take of the conversation between Deckard and Taffy. The voiceover discusses how unreliable Taffy is.\n\nBackstage Pass: A barman tells Deckard that Taffy won't know anything about the scale, but the performers might, and he tells him to go backstage to find out. The voiceover here talks about how he suspects Zhora is a replicant, but isn't 100% sure.\n\nLooks Like Blood: An alternate version of the scene after Deckard has killed Zhora. The voiceover here talks about the moral ambiguities of the work.\n\nWashing Up: An alternate version of the scene where Deckard washes up and goes to sleep, with more footage of Rachael simply watching him.\n\nI Want You: A longer version of the sex scene, which shows both Deckard and Rachael undressing one another.\n\nMetaphysics: Deckard again visits Holden, who thinks Deckard had slept with Zhora and mocks him for it. Holden then tells Deckard that the replicants are looking for God. Bryant and Gaff are shown to be spying on the scene, discussing whether or not Deckard knows where Rachael is.\n\nTyrell Security Protocol: Different versions of Roy and Sebastian approaching the Tyrell suite, and of Roy leaving. Both scenes involve a security pass that has to be input into a slot on the elevator within a certain time or the elevator will be locked down. Additionally, as Roy leaves, he is clearly upset, almost frantic.\n\nClosing In: A different version of the scene where Deckard calls Sebastian's. In this version, the conversation with the Spinner cop is longer, and the cop is actually seen on a small TV in Deckard's car. The real difference, however, is the voiceover. At this stage, Deckard doesn't know that Tyrell is dead. However, Rachael has guessed that the replicants want more life, which means they need to see Tyrell.

Rachael tells Deckard that it is the happiest day of her life. Interestingly, Rachael then says, \"You and I were made for one another,\" to which Deckard responds strangely, looking at her rather bemusedly (this line has been suggested to be another hint that Deckard is a replicant)."], ["Is this film available on Blu-ray?", "Yes it is. In the US, the Five-Disc Edition is available in two formats; the Collector's Edition and the Ultimate Collector's Edition. Both editions contain the same special features as the 5-disc DVD, but the Ultimate Edition comes in a replica of Rick Deckard's briefcase, and contains a 16-page booklet, a lenticular motion film clip, a letter from 'Ridley Scott' (qv), an art folio containing storyboards, production illustrations and concept drawings, a mini spinner, and a paper origami unicorn. These additional extras are absent in the standard Blu-ray Collector's Edition. The film is also available in a two disc version in both the US and the UK, which contains the Final Cut, plus the three commentaries and the Dangerous Days documentary.\n\nAlso available in both the US and the UK is the 30th Anniversary Ultimate Collector's Edition, released in 2012. The US edition is a four disc set, the UK edition a three disc set. Both contain everything from the 5-disc Ultimate Collector's Edition DVD and 5-disc Collector's Edition Blu-ray, but all of the special features are now in HD (except Dangerous Days). Additionally, both come with a UV copy of the film and a 72-page The Art Of _Blade Runner_ (qv) book. The reason the US set is a four disk set and the UK a three disk set is because the US set contains a DVD copy of the Final Cut.

He has called it \"more of a mood title than anything else.\" One popular and oft-told story about the origin of the title is that former video store employee Tarantino used to mangle the title of the French film _Au revoir les enfants_ (qv), and his mispronounciation gave birth to the phrase \"Reservoir dogs.\" 'Lawrence Tierney' (qv) (who plays Joe Cabot) reportedly told a German reporter that Reservoir dogs was \"a very famous expression in America for dogs who hang around a reservoir.\""], ["What are the characters' real names?", "We never learn the real names of Mr. Brown, Mr. Blue, or Mr. Pink.

The leading theories are that the ring is a good luck charm, or that it is a prop for Orange's cover story about his life. Film critic 'Peter Travers' (qv) cited the song that plays over the scene, 'Sandy Rogers' (qv)'s \"Fool For Love,\" as a possible hint that the ring is linked to a current or former wife of Orange. With no formal explanation, the ring remains a tantalizing mystery."], ["What does Mr. Orange say to Mr. White as they're entering the warehouse?", "There is an unclear bit of dialogue from Mr. Orange as Mr. White drags him into the warehouse. He seems to be saying, \"She had a baby, man! She had a baby!\" This is likely in reference to the woman that Orange shot, as there is a noticeable child's car seat in the back of the woman's car where the terrified Orange lies after he has been wounded. He kicks the car seat multiple times in that scene. The baby obviously isn't in it and didn't seem to be in the car, so Orange is probably feeling guilty about shooting a woman who might have been a mother."], ["What happens to Mr. Brown?", "There has been some confusion among viewers as to how Mr. Brown is killed. Because Brown is the getaway driver, and we see him crash the car before we see him injured, some viewers come to think that he has been injured in the crash. Others theorize that he is killed by Mr. Orange, to whom he is talking just before his death. In actuality, as Mr. White tells Mr. Pink, Brown was shot by the police (possibly the officers that Mr. White later fires on). He crashes the car as a result of his soon-to-be-fatal injury. Mr. Orange does not harm Mr. Brown - his shell-shocked behavior after Brown's death is due to the violence that he is witnessing and not yet any that he has committed. He has, after all, just seen his friend Mr. White gun down two of his fellow officers."], ["How is it that Mr. Brown didn't die right away?", "Just because someone is shot in the head doesn't mean they die instantly, or at all for that matter. The bullet may have skimmed his head but not gone deep enough to be fatal. It's likely that the wound caused Brown to bleed to death rather than dying from brain tissue trauma. Another possibility is that the injury to his brain didn't cause him to react right away & it took some time before he felt the effect."], ["Why are there coffins in the warehouse?", "Sharp-eyed fans have spotted the coffins standing in the warehouse where the thieves have their rendezvous. Given that the robbers are all wearing typical funeral attire (black suits, white shirts and black ties), it's possible that the hearse and coffins were intended as a cover to allow them to escape later on as part of a fake funeral procession. Because the warehouse used as a major shooting location for the film was once an actual mortuary, the set designers decided to run with it, adding the coffins as well as a hearse, which Mr. Blonde can be seen sitting on. The morbid decor can easily be interpreted as foreshadowing."], ["What does the graffiti in the warehouse say?", "The graffiti visible in the film's famous torture scene reads \"Watch your head,\" appropriate given that Marvin's ear is being hacked off. There seems to be another word above 'watch your head.' Though it isn't clear if it is or not, it looks like it reads 'Tony.' So the whole saying could be \"Tony watch your head.\" Assuming this is true, we can assume there is a person who works in the warehouse who is unusually taller than everyone else, because the archway is pretty tall, and most people wouldn't need to watch their heads."], ["Who shot Nice Guy Eddie?", "A famous source of confusion for viewers of _Reservoir Dogs_ (qv) is how, in the climactic Mexican stand-off, Nice Guy Eddie is killed. The bullets were supposed to fly thusly: Joe shoots Mr. Orange, Eddie shoots Mr. White, and Mr. White shoots Joe and then Eddie. However, during filming Eddie ('Chris Penn' (qv))'s squib went off before Mr. White was able to get to him, and he fell to the floor anyway. Hence, the confusion began. Tarantino has claimed that he realized the mistake, but left it in the film to give people something to talk about. Seeing as how Mr. Orange did not have a loaded gun at that time, Mr. White is really the only possible candidate for Eddie's shooting and if you watch the scene in slow motion, as Mr. White is falling, he clearly turns and fires at Eddie. A far-fetched theory is that Mr. Pink, hiding underneath the ramp shot Eddie, so Pink would be the last man standing and get away with the diamonds, though he seemed to want to stay out of it completely."], ["Why does Mr. Orange tell Mr. White the truth?", "On the commentary track for the 2002 10th Anniversary Edition DVD of _Reservoir Dogs_ (qv), 'Quentin Tarantino' (qv) insists that viewers who don't understand why Mr. Orange tells Mr. White that he is an undercover cop (knowing full well that Mr. White is likely to kill him upon finding out) have not understood the film. Mr. Orange tells Mr. White, who has acted as his protector throughout the film, the truth because he feels that he owes it to him as a matter of honor. Tarantino actually described it as something beyond honor, best summed up by the Japanese word \"jingi\" that has no English equivalent. Having witnessed White sacrifice everything for him; White kills two very good friends of his to protect Orange, taking a bullet and willing to stay behind and lose out on the diamonds and go to prison rather than leave Orange for dead...Orange feels compelled to do likewise.\nOrange does not reveal the truth until the final moment because it is only then that he is free to do so without forsaking his duty as a police officer.

A devastated Mr. White puts his gun to Orange's head. The police burst in and are heard off-camera urging Mr. White to put his gun down.

The video game based on the movie reveals he was cornered and shot by the cops in a movie theater, but this may not be canon.\n\nMr. Brown: Shot in the head while driving the getaway vehicle. He crashes, tries to get the car free (the bumpers were locked up in the crash), then dies.\n\nMr. Blonde: While torturing Marvin Nash, Blonde decides to burn him alive, at this point Mr. Orange awakens and unloads his gun into Mr. Blonde.\n\nMarvin Nash: Saved from burning to death by Mr. Orange, but when Nice Guy Eddie and the others arrive and find Mr. Blonde shot to death it so enrages Eddie that he shoots Marvin three times in the chest, killing him.\n\nJoe Cabot: Shot by Mr. White in the Mexican stand-off at the end.\n\nNice Guy Eddie: Also shot by Mr. White in the Mexican stand off. (Though this is debated, the logical answer within the film is that Mr. White turned and shot him as he fell over. Watching the sequence in slow motion also shows this.)\n\nMr. Orange: Shot in the gut during the original getaway by the woman who's car he and Larry stole, bleeding out and unconscious through most of the scenes after the robbery, he comes to and is shot again by Joe in the Mexican stand-off because he suspected Orange of being a cop/rat. Though he doesn't die from this injury, a wounded Mr. White cradles his friend, Mr. Orange, in his arms, trying to console him, hearing the sirens outside. Mr. Orange revealed that he was actually a cop and says he is sorry. Mr. White, realizing that he just killed two of his best friends to protect a new friend who was in fact a cop, is overcome with emotion, pulls out his gun, places it against Mr. Orange's head and pulls the trigger.\n\nMr. White: He is first shot by Eddie in the Mexican stand-off, and the police storm the warehouse just in time to see Mr. White putting the gun against Mr. Orange's head. They order him repeatedly to drop the gun, but he shoots Mr. Orange and in turn is gunned down by the police.\n\nMr. Pink: The only person to survive the ordeal. He tries to reason with the others during the Mexican stand-off but after realizing that nobody is listening to him, he hides underneath the ramp until the shooting stops. He then crawls out, grabs the diamonds and leaves. If you listen closely to the background you can hire sirens, cars crashing and gunfire. This leads people to believe he was killed; however, there is dialogue afterward where you hear police yelling at him to get out of the car, and Mr. Pink can be heard saying \"Don't shoot me; I've been shot, goddamn it!\" and then the police yell \"Are you a cop killer? Did you kill a cop?\" Seconds later they break into the warehouse to find Mr. White and Mr. Orange. In the videogame, depending on how many people you kill, Mr. Pink can: (1) die, (2) get arrested, or (3) get away without the diamonds (although he did put two handfuls in his pockets)."], ["Is this film a remake of 'Lung fu fong wan'?", "Following the incredible critical and popular success of Tarantino's movies in the mid-1990's, it was rumored that _Reservoir Dogs_ (qv) was actually an uncredited remake of 'Ringo Lam' (qv)'s Hong Kong actioner _Lung foo fong wan_ (qv) City On Fire. The rumor was fueled by _Who Do You Think You're Fooling?_ (qv), a short film by 'Mike White' (qv) that spliced together clips of _Reservoir Dogs_ (qv) and Lung fu fong wan to reveal their similarities. And there are clear similarities. Both films deal with a robbery, and feature a warehouse rendez-vous spot, a climactic Mexican stand-off, and the relationship between a veteran thief and an undercover cop, but Lung fu fong wan deals mostly with events leading to the robbery, while _Reservoir Dogs_ (qv) is about the aftermath of an unseen heist gone wrong. Also, the Mexican stand-off in Lung fu fong wan does not end with all the guns going off and all the gunmen hitting the floor. The poetic justice and irony of _Reservoir Dogs_ (qv) at the end of the movie is also absent from Lung fu fong wan. Instead, the police officer character bleeds to death. There are similar elements between the two films, but much of what makes _Reservoir Dogs_ (qv) a classic - pacing, style, and some famous plot twists - is not present in Lung fu fong wan. Nevertheless, the debate has continued among some film fans.

Tarantino has often discussed the possibility of creating a prequel to both films called \"The Vega Brothers.\" As years pass, the likelihood of the film materializing seems to grow slimmer. It has nevertheless been a popular source of Internet rumors. Mr. White also shares the last name \"Dimmick\" with _Pulp Fiction_ (qv)'s Jimmy Dimmick. There is also a link to the Tarantino-penned _True Romance_ (qv). Mr. White talks to Joe about his former partnership with a woman named Alabama. Alabama was the name of the call girl-turned-fugitive in _True Romance_ (qv). Other less obvious connections include the fact that both _Reservoir Dogs_ (qv) and _Pulp Fiction_ (qv) feature unfortunate characters named Marvin and Marcellus.

There's also a colorful connection between the names of 'Tim Roth' (qv)'s reservoir dog Mr. Orange and his _Pulp Fiction_ (qv) character, Pumpkin. Finally, when Joe and Mr. White are talking, Joe mentions 'Marsellus Spivey.' In _True Romance_ (qv), the pimp's name is Drexel Spivey. Mr. Blonde's parole officer's name is Seymour Scagnetti.

Jack Scagnetti (_Natural Born Killers_ (qv)) and Seymour Scagnetti (mentioned in _Reservoir Dogs_ (qv)) could be related. One theory that has been suggested is that they are the same person, that Seymour had changed his name to Jack for unknown reasons. Drexl Spivey (_True Romance_ (qv)) and Marsellus Spivey (mentioned in _Reservoir Dogs_ (qv)) could be related.

She meant Bourne to hear this and he reacts in the scene to the statement. This is why Vosen puts the phone on mute while he and Landy argue.

From the mosquitoes, they extracted the preserved remains of blood. From the blood, they extracted the dinosaur DNA. Any gaps in the DNA sequence were filled in with frog DNA. The resulting embryo clones were subsequently treated so as to produce only females so that there would be no natural breeding. The animals hatched normally, were nurtured on Isla Nublar, and some were then transferred to the 'park' seen in this film."], ["What is the Spanish translation for the dialogue spoken by the amber mine workers?", "When Gennaro arrives on the raft one of the guys says \"[I bet] 1000 pesos he falls\".

The Triceratops (in the novel, it was a Stegosaurus) digests food like vegetables or fruit by swallowing small stones (called \"gizzard stones\") that crush and mash the food in the stomach. The stones it eats are too close to the poisonous West Indian Lilac berries. Therefore, when it replaces the stones every six weeks or so, it simultaneously picks up fallen berries and is poisoned again. This is suggested in the scene where Dr. Sattler crouches down by the lilac berry bush, picks up some small stones, and plays with them in the air for a second. She fails to find berries in the animal's excrement because the berries are regurgitated along with the stones."], ["Was Gennaro actually using the toilet when he was eaten by the T-Rex?", "No. While it is unclear whether he soiled his underwear upon experiencing the T-Rex knocking the toilet down around him, it is clear that he only ran to the toilet to hide from the dinosaur.

A scene similar to this appeared in the book, though the unfortunate victim was Ed Regis, who does not appear in the film. Ed Regis is present during the main road attack in the book, and like Gennaro, he abandons the children upon seeing the T-Rex. The book makes clear that Regis wets himself.

Computer simulations using the T. rex's skeletal structure have found that it probably only ran at a maximum of 11-18 mph and that its legs, in ratio to the rest of its body, were not large enough to propel it beyond 25 mph. It was Ian's leaning back in terror that stopped the car from accelerating at first, resulting in the close shave before the getaway. When Ian leans back, he knocks the gear shift lever loose which put the Jeep in neutral. You can hear Muldoon shouting \"GET OFF THE STICK! BLOODY MOVE!!!\" to Ian."], ["What is the 'Lysine Contingency' and why was Hammond against using it?", "Lysine is an amino acid, one of the 'building blocks' of protein. Specifically, it is one of nine 'essential' amino acids that cannot be manufactured by the body and must be consumed in food. Sources of lysine include eggs, meat, soy, milk, Parmesan cheese, fish, and most grains and legumes. The lysine contingency plan called for withholding lysine from the dinosaurs' diets in order to kill them, if necessary. It was included in the construction of the animals' DNA so they could only survive with the diets provided in the park, i.e., they could not survive off the island. However, death by lack of lysine would take a long time, several weeks and even longer for the meat eaters since digestion of meat produces lysine. Hammond was against using the plan for the obvious reason...he didn't want to kill off all the dinosaurs, lose his investment, and be forced to start all over again. It might also be said that he felt a small compassion for his creations (which is why he screamed at Grant over the phone when he heard him shooting at the Raptors). While he certainly felt an attachment to the animals a more plausible explanation of his decision can be ascertained by his exclamation to John Arnold that 'people are dying!' Arnold was adamant he didn't want to be responsible for rebooting the park systems as they may not have come back on at all and seemed more in favour of Muldoon's suggestion to use the lysine contingency. However this would have taken too long to come into effect whereas 'theoretically' rebooting the system would have given them almost immediate control."], ["How does the movie end?", "Alan, Ellie, Lex, and Tim evade the Velociraptors thanks to the intervention of a T. rex.

Grant looks out of the window and sees birds flying in the sky and smiles, not aware that Nedry's stolen canister of dinosaur embryos is still out there."], ["How did the T. rex enter the Visitor's Center at the end of the movie?", "The Visitor's Center was still under construction.

The ethical and religious issues alone are enough to stop the development of one anyway. Crichton was fully aware of this when writing the story, but he needed a way for dinosaurs to exist in modern day. So, he created a plot device using cloning. In the book, however, it was explained that these were not exact replicas of their prehistoric ancestors but \"Dr. Henry Wu's creations\" made from fragments of DNA available, and corrected and changed according to the needs of the client, Mr. Hammond. The animals replicated in this way would have represented a truly towering achievement in the biological sciences -- the manufacture of fully synthetic organisms with structures based on theoretical models as opposed to truly observed biology. That the dinosaurs thus manufactured display the characteristics of natural organisms, including responding to environmental pressures (such as the all-female population, and lysinergic biochemical pathway degradation) increases the magnitude of the achievement. To put it simply, these are manufactured creatures made to look and act as real dinosaurs would have, but they are not 100% clones. Although scientists have been able to create totally synthetic life and, at least theoretically, if you used the DNA of a bird (the current believed closest relative to the dinosaurs) to fill in the gaps, you could create a dinosaur-like animal. This also explains how the dinosaurs were able to spontaneously change sex, whereas real dinosaurs presumably wouldn't have this ability. It may also explain the ferocity of some dinosaurs that in real life may not have been quite as hostile such as the Spinosaurus in _Jurassic Park III_ (qv). For more details on the cloning check here."], ["What are some of the differences between the film and the novel?", "While the film follows the plot relatively close, the book and film have several differences. Almost every character is somewhat different in the book than the film. For example:\n\nIn the book Gennaro is a young, muscular man and is a fairly likeable character. Also, in the book, he lives. Near the end of the book, after the main characters part company with Hammond, Gennaro becomes a sort of scapegoat and is blamed by Grant for the dangers they are facing. In the second book (The Lost World) it is mentioned that he died of dysentary on a business trip in between the timeline of the two stories. There is another character named Ed Regis who works on the island and goes on the tour with the others, as Gennaro stayed with Ellie to look after the sick Stegosaurus in the book. In the film Gennaro is combined with many of Ed Regis' traits and is killed in a very similar way to Regis.\n\nMuldoon is pretty much the same in both the book and the film, only he is described as being South-African and might have a drinking problem, whereas in the film he is British. In the book he is wounded but lives. In the film he dies.\n\nNedry is exactly the same, almost down to the last detail. He dies in the same way in both the film and the book, though the book is more graphic (he's disemboweled and his head is ripped off). In the film, he is portrayed as being solely motivated by greed. In the book, it's made clear that Hammond mislead him about the programming job he was given. It was far more time consuming and complicated for the pay he was getting. He planned to quit, but Hammond threatened him with a lawsuit and would make sure Nedry could never get a high-level job again if he tried to leave. So his motivations were more about fair compensation as well as settling a score against Hammond. Also, in the book he was planning to shut down the security system, deliver the embryos to some people on a boat, then return to the control room and reset everything to normal and nobody would be the wiser, but was killed before he could return to reset everything. In the film it is unclear whether he was deliberately sabotaging the park and was planning to escape on the boat, or if he was going to return to the control room. Though him stating he had an \"18 minute window\" suggests he was planning to return. He also left the raptor fence on, likely because it was a separate facility and not directly connected to the gate he needed to open and didn't want to risk them escaping.\n\nDr. Harding has a brief appearance in the movie as the veterinarian looking after the sick Triceratops, but then leaves on the boat heading to the mainland. In the book, he stays on the Island throughout the whole ordeal. He is wounded by a Raptor, but lives.\n\nDr. Henry Wu has a much more significant role in the book than in the film. In the book he explains in great detail how the dinosaurs are cloned, etc. He too stays on the island throughout the ordeal and is killed by Raptors near the end of the book. In the film he declares that he is leaving on a boat, meaning he survives the film and returns in Jurassic World\n\nIn the film Ray Arnold is the lead computer engineer. In the book his name is John Arnold (it was changed most likely due to the fact that there was a character named John Hammond, and having two Johns in the film might be confusing, though some sources name him as \"John Raymond Arnold\"). His traits are very similar in both the book and the film. In the book, he is also a US Navy veteran. In the film he goes missing and Ellie finds his severed arm. In the book, the reader follows him into the maintenance shed, where he's gutted by a raptor.\n\nIan Malcolm is described in the same way in both the book and the film, except in the book he is 'a balding man'. In the film he is witty and also provides the comic relief. In the book he is still humourous and witty at times, but mostly he's much more serious, philosophical and at times condescending. He and John Hammond absolutely loathe each other in the book, whereas in the film, Hammond only seems annoyed by Malcolm, as Malcolm never passes up an opportunity to get on Hammond's nerves. In the book he panics, runs out of the car and gets bitten by the Rex, which in turn breaks his leg in several places. In the film, he nobly distracts the Rex with a flare in order for Grant to rescue the kids. He is sent flying into the bathroom hut on the snout of the Rex, breaking his leg. In the book he dies from his injury, but he is resurrected for the second book by saying \"I only appeared dead, but the surgeons did excellent work to revive me.\"\n\nAlan Grant is very casual in the book. He wears tattered jeans, sneakers, and has a beard. In the film he is much more clean-cut, wearing collared shirts and khaki pants, and is clean-shaven. Also, in the book he likes kids, whereas in the film he initially hates kids, but grows to enjoy their company as the film progresses. Near the end of the book, having survived the trek through the jungle, he becomes hostile towards Gennaro in Hammond's absence and blames him for the circumstances they and the rest of the survivors are facing.\n\nIn the book, Tim is eleven years old and the eldest of the children, while he is two years younger in the film. Lex is only seven and doesn't provide much to the plot in the book whereas, in the film, she is twelve years old and plays an equal role to her screen brother. Tim is the one who is good with computers and helps activate the park security systems in the book while also aware he has to protect his sister. Lex becomes the computer expert in the film, while Tim is the dinosaur expert.\n\nJohn Hammond is very different in the book. He is arrogant, deceptive, disrespectful and rude, and described as almost dwarf-like in his appearance. He recognises the consequences of his experiments but disregards them in the name of profit. He also tries to blame all the faults of the park on his employees, dismissing the park's failure on the supposed incompetence of Wu, Arnold, Nedry, Harding and Muldoon. In the film he is still eccentric but he is very friendly, honest and generous, and does not appear to fully grasp the reality of what he's done until the end of the film; at one point in the movie he criticizes Gennaro's idea of the park as a playground for the rich, which is essentially what the Hammond in the book is trying to create. In the book he refuses to leave the island with Grant and instead ventures off into the park by himself, where he injures himself falling down a cliff and is summarily eaten by chicken-like dinosaurs called Procompsognathus (which appear in the second and briefly in the third film). In the film he survives, and makes an appearance in later films.\n\nEllie Sattler is described as being 23, tanned, and is noticed more by the male characters. In the film she is dating Grant and is rather reserved. In the book she is Grant's student and is engaged to someone else.\n\nLewis Dodgson gets a bit more mention in the book and its sequel, The Lost World. His role in both the book and the film are pretty much the same: he meets Nedry and pays him off, then isn't seen again. However, a bit more background on his character is given in the book. In the second book, The Lost World, he is the main antagonist and is killed at the end. In the films he pays off Nedry and is never seen again.\n\nAt one point in the novel, Alan, Lex, and Tim ride a boat down a river, one of the rides yet to be completed. While on the boat they are chased by the swimming T-Rex and enter a large birdcage with Cearadactylus. Both events were eventually used in _Jurassic Park III_ (qv), though the T-Rex is replaced with a Spinosaurus.\n\nIn the book, at one point Lex, Tim and Grant are behind a waterfall and the T-Rex attempts to attack them. Though the opening was too small for the Rex to get his head in. This idea was used in the second film, The Lost World\n\nThe beginning of the book has a wounded worker being airlifted to a local hospital in Costa Rica; before dying he mutters, \"Raptor\". In the film we see this worker being attacked by the Raptor (though not too graphically), but it is only mentioned later on that he died.\n\nShortly after the worker died, the book follows a family on vacation on the main land of Costa Rica. When on the beach, their young daughter is attacked by these chicken-like lizards, which turned out to be Procompsognathus. It begs the question as to how these small dinosaurs had gotten off the island. In the film, this scene never happens, though it did in the sequel The Lost World: _Jurassic Park_ (qv) (albeit on Isla Sorna as opposed to Costa Rica).\n\nAt the end of the book, Isla Nublar gets napalmed, completely wiping out every living thing on the island. Hence the need for a site B in the second book. In the film, no such thing is said to have happened. A deleted scene in the The Lost World mentions that the \"original facility was destroyed\", referencing the sequence in the book where this happens. Though because it was deleted, it isn't considered canon. Also, Jurassic World takes place on Isla Nublar. So it's likely that the original facility being destroyed may have been due to a hurricane or some other natural element. The visitor's appears in Jurassic World briefly, still intact, but decimated and over-grown with plant life, in the restricted zone of the island.\n\nIn the book, the facility isn't manned by a skeleton crew of three due to an incoming storm. There are dozens of people still working on the island, including general labourers who are working to finish construction on the island and several are killed when the raptors get loose.\n\nIn the book, the Velociraptors are described as having a snout like a crocodile and they are only about 4 feet tall (though one is described as being 6 feet tall). Still larger than their real life counterparts which were about 1 and a half to 2 feet tall. In the film, they are about 6 feet tall and share more physical traits with the larger Utahraptor."], ["How accurate are the dinosaur reconstructions according to modern science?", "Due to the fact that according to both the novel and movie, these \"dinosaurs\" are actually just human-engineered mutants, most of these inaccuracies can be explained in-universe as being just the results of the geneticist's tampering. The closest the films have come to acknowledging this is in _Jurassic Park III_ (qv) when Grant says \"What Hammond, and Ingen, did at _Jurassic Park_ (qv) was to create genetically-engineered theme park monsters, nothing more; nothing less.\" -- the novel at least made it clear that the clones are just approximations, and not real dinosaurs. However in Jurassic World, Dr. Wu mentions that his creations are not real dinosaurs and simply what people expect to see. That the real animals would look quite different.\n\nThis topic has became one of the most frequently discussed among paleontology enthusiasts, mostly because of how much our understanding of these creatures has progressed, and because there are many fans of _Jurassic Park_ (qv) who refuse to accept that the dinosaurs in the movie are in several aspects inaccurate. Further, since to many moviegoers these films provide the sole source of information about dinosaurs, arguments about the topic occur frequently when a more knowledgeable person points out their ignorance. These inaccuracies aren't all mistakes. While some dinosaurs were indeed changed to make them better movie monsters (especially the raptors), most are the result of the relatively limited knowledge we possessed back when the movie was made. It should be noted that paleontology is an ever-advancing field of science, and as such, our image of these animals is always changing. A general overview on these paleontologic inaccuracies:\n\n* The Tyrannosaurus is in fact one of the most accurate to appear in any popular media, including documentaries. However the shape of the head is too blocky and a bit wide, while the eyebrow ridges are far too pronounced (the animal in reality possessed only smaller \"bumps\" in front of the eyes). The arms appear to be just a tad too long and articulated, and the hands are able to twits. In reality, the wrists were fixed into a nearly immobile position, facing each other, but this is a relatively new discovery. As is the one made about the creature's hide: fossilized skin impressions show the animal had a heterogeneous, goosebumps-like skin texture on parts of its body, as opposed to scales, and this is evidence that, at least early in its life, T. rex was feathered. Further, it belongs to the coelurosaurian dinosaurs, whose defining features include having fuzz or feathers -- modern birds and raptors also belong to this group. Scales were present on its throat-sac and on various parts of its body, though, like the underside of its tail. In the film, Dr. Grant states that its vision was based on movement, however we have no way of knowing this. We do know its eyes were very developed and that T. rex had great binocular vision, so it probably had no trouble seeing anything. Unlike the movie, the original _Jurassic Park_ (qv) novel mentions that the inefficiency of the beast's eyes was actually due to gene-modification, and not a natural handicap.\n\n* The Triceratops is also highly accurate, though we now know that its front feet had five toes instead of four, three of which were long and clawed, with the other two ending in stubs. These were also quite slender, and the back legs even resembled the legs of birds. In the movie, they are more elephantine. Also, a spectacular fossil find, an imprint of the skin of Triceratops, tells us that the scales on its belly were large and rectangular, while (most amazingly) the back of the creature may have had porcupine-like quills protruding from it.\n\n* The Velociraptors in the movie became so embedded into public mind that a lot of people find it hard to accept that the real animals looked almost nothing like them. The raptors here are actually based on Deinonychus, a wolf-sized American dromaeosaur, rather than the Asian and turkey-sized Velociraptor. The book points this out, the movie does not. Even so, the anatomy of these \"Deinonychus\" is wrong in nearly every aspect. They are too big -- shown to be able to look a human right in the eye, however true Deinonychus would only come up to our waist or chest. This is because the legs of raptors were surprisingly short. Despite what the movie tells us, they (or at least the more advanced raptors, such as Deinonychus, Velociraptor and the gigantic Utahraptor) were bad runners, and likely ambushed their prey. Their claws weren't suited for slashing, as their inner rim was more rounded than sharp, better suited for climbing and puncturing than making cuts. The tail of raptors is shown as relatively short and bendy in the movies, but they were really much longer and quite stiff (the animals belonged to a dinosaur group called tetanurae, meaning \"stiff tails\"). They were flexible to a degree, but incapable of flailing around. The skull of the movie-raptors is blocky and stout, and doesn't match that of any known dromaeosaur. Their arms, or rather wings, are almost human-like. In reality, they were unable to rotate their wrists, meaning their hands were permanently stuck in a \"clapping\" position. They would thus have been unable to open doors. They also didn't hold their wings in front of their bodies. Paleontologists believe they held them at their sides and to the back. This made them more aerodynamic, and kept their feathers from touching the ground.\n\nMost famously, raptors were feathered. Fossilized feathers show these were the same as the pennaceous feathers of modern birds, and not the type of primitive \"fuzz\" that a lot of other dinosaurs (for instance T. rex) had. Their arms were lined with long, sturdy feathers, the type birds use for flying -- many smaller raptors were indeed capable of using them to glide through the air, although not being able to lift them above their shoulder-line, they couldn't flap their wings. The wing-feathers extended from their middle digits, not from their wrists as many erroneous reconstructions show, which would have made the hands even less dexterous. Essentially, they had \"wings with claws\" rather than \"arms with feathers\". Raptors were covered head-to tail in feathers, and possessed fans on the end of their tail. Only the tip of their snout and their feet had scales, although some even had feathers sprouting from their toes.\n\nThere are a number of theories regarding their hunting strategy. The famous Fighting Dinosaurs fossil, in which a Velociraptor and Protoceratops were found locked in combat at the time of their death, shows the raptor sticking its claw into the herbivore's neck, which many see as proof that raptors used their claws this way -- others claim that the animal was trying to push itself away from the Protoceratops, and that the raptor wasn't the real attacker in this scenario. Another theory says that they would have gone for smaller prey, and then clawed it to death while standing upright over it, using their wings to balance themselves and to keep other raptors away by forming a \"shield\" around their meal. It is unlikely that they used their teeth or wing claws for killing. There is no evidence to suggest raptors were pack hunters. This theory was based on several Deinonychus skeletons that have been discovered together with the skeleton of a herbivorous dinosaur, but recent studies indicate that these weren't found together because they formed a pack when alive, but because they came to feed off the carcass, and subsequently fought over it, during which many Deinonychus were killed -- their remains also show signs of scavenging, meaning they could have eaten each other. Also, while raptors were probably smart for dinosaurs, they likely lacked the necessary intelligence needed for coordinated assaults. However there exists a fossil trackway that shows a bunch of these animals walking in a group, so the question of whether they were social or not has yet to be cleared. Furthermore, different types of raptors had different jaws -- velociraptorines had relatively weaker jaws than dromaeosaurines, which suggest that they relied primarily on their claws while hunting, which would have been more useful for bringing down larger prey. Thus some scientists still believe that the pack hunting theory holds water.\n\n* The Dilophosaurus is another animal whose appearance the movie famously changed. For starters, it's far too small -- true Dilophosaurus were about 6 m long, and as tall as a person (described in the book but not the film). The one in the movie could be just a juvenile, though (as Nedry says \"I thought you were one of your big brothers. You're not so bad.\" implying that it was in fact a juvenile, yet just as deadly). The iconic frill was, however, only made up by Steven Spielberg, and its venom-spitting ability is also artistic license, used to demonstrate what little fossils actually tell us about dinosaurs. Accordingly, neither of these traits have any scientific basis, nor do they make logical sense: if a carnivore attempted to attack another animal in this theatrical manner, the prey would have plenty of time to just run away. The shape of the animal's head is also wrong: it's short, stout and compact, whereas the jaws of Dilophosaurus were famously thin and long, and the upper jaw had a small notch at the tip, which the movie version lacks entirely. Likewise, the palms should be facing each other, and the animal had four fingers, not three.\n\n* Brachiosaurus is shown chewing by moving its jaw from side to side, which is a motion the skull was incapable of doing. Further, its teeth were only meant for stripping off branches, while the stones the animal swallowed did the grinding. Brachiosaurs were the sauropods least capable of rearing up on their hind legs, especially as their backs sloped toward their rear, and because their hind legs were shorter than their front ones. On their front feet, they only had one claw, while the other four fingers were reduced to mere stumps. Sauropods were famously believed to have had their nostrils placed high up on their foreheads.

It is worth noting that the Brachiosaurus here (as well as in just about any popular media) was based on fossils that have since been reclassified to a related genus, Giraffatitan, which was for almost a century regarded as a species of Brachiosaurus. We now see them as different genera, and the build of Brachiosaurus would had been slightly different -- its torso would have been more tubular, for example, and the \"bulge\" on its forehead would have been less pronounced.\n\nGallimimus should be fuzzy, with the arms being lined with sturdy wing feathers, and their palms should be facing inward."], ["Is it true that a _Jurassic Park_ (qv) TV series was supposed to be released in the late 1990's?", "Yes. The series was to have been a direct sequel to \"The Lost World: _Jurassic Park_ (qv)\", itself a sequel to this film, and was to be the premise of the Chaos Effect line of toys, depicting scientists cross-breeding dinosaurs that are decreasing in their population, five years after the second film. It went pretty far into production, even including creature designs and meetings with Steven Spielberg himself, but the project never took off. The toys were too far into production to be withdrawn and were ultimately released to mixed reactions.

Some viewers have suggested that the briefcase contains: Marsellus Wallace's soul, the ear, the stolen diamonds from _Reservoir Dogs (1992)_ (qv), OJ's or Michael Jackson's other gloves, the Oscar that Tarantino hopes to win, Judy Davis' head from _Barton Fink (1991)_ (qv), laundered money, gold bullion, Marsellus's dirty laundry, or a 25-watt transparent amber light bulb, which is the prop used to create the effect. In other words, it could be anything."], ["Does Quentin Tarantino have a cameo?", "Yes, more of a minor role than a cameo. He plays Jimmy Dimmick, the guy who helps Jules and Vincent out after Vince shot Marvin. He loans them his garage until they can figure out a way out of their predicament. Tarantino had originally intended to play Lance, the guy who deals heroin to Vincent, but he switched roles because he wanted to direct the scene with the adrenaline shot."], ["Why would Vince, a professional, leave a submachine gun on the counter at Butch's apartment for anyone to pick up while he uses the toilet?", "The MAC-10 belongs to Marsellus, who is staking out Butch's apartment with Vincent, but has gone for coffee and donuts, breakfast for himself and Vincent -- Marsellus wouldn't have been able to conceal the MAC-10 on his person very easily if he'd taken it with him to get breakfast. Butch is extremely fortunate: his timing couldn't have been better when he entered his apartment while Marcellus was gone and Vincent was in the bathroom. Vincent probably hears Butch come in, but believing it is Marsellus, is not alarmed. As Butch is driving away after having retrieved his watch and killed Vincent, he encounters Marsellus on his way back to the apartment, carrying a box of donuts and two cups of coffee. The \"trivia track\" on the DVD confirms this interpretation to be correct. An added explanation that does not disagree with the above but adds a psychological dimension is that Vincent is demonstrably very careless with guns. In another scene, this carelessness costs someone else (Marvin) his life. Here, Vincent carelessly assumes that Butch would not be dumb enough to come back to his own apartment and, so, allows the gun to go unattended in the kitchen while he uses the facilities. (Vincent is seen to be using the facilities more often than any other character in the movie, at least three times, twice while reading the same book. The theme throughout the film is that whenever Vincent goes into the bathroom, something bad happens: Mia overdoses on his heroin, he's killed by Butch & he finds himself in the middle of Pumpkin & Honeybunny's robbery of the restaurant.) It's also not out of the realm of possibility that Vincent didn't even know Marsellus had put the MAC-10 on the counter. If Vincent likes to read while using the restroom, it's entirely possible he was in there a while and may have been in there before Marsellus even left."], ["Why is what Yolanda says in the beginning different from what she says at the end?", "Tarantino has explained that this is not an error, rather, he did this on purpose. When we first examine the scene, we are seeing Ringo and Yolanda's conversation from their perspective. Because this is their conversation, what we hear first is probably what was actually said. However, at the end of the film, what is said is different because we are no longer viewing the situation from Ringo and Yolanda's perspective, but rather everyone else in the diner, most specifically Jules."], ["Why does Butch save Marsellus?", "It's a question of honor: Butch puts himself in Marsellus' position and decides that he would hate to be left to such a horrid fate - he cannot just leave somebody there, no matter who it is. Butch does the \"right thing\" to put it simply - he realises that Maynard and Zed cannot get away with what they are doing to anybody -- who knows how many people they've raped, tortured or even killed in Maynard's basement? Butch may have also considered saving Marsellus an act of redemption. By saving his skin, he may have hoped that Marsellus would forgive him and let him go, if not, Butch may have killed Marsellus himself. Notice how Butch still stood ready to swing with the sword when he asked \"What now?\". The former becomes the case, whether that was Butch's intention or not. Also, if Marsellus ever escaped and learned that Butch had left him there to his fate, Marsellus would sure unleash even more retaliation against Butch than he was subject to after double-crossing him at the fight. Consider the weapon Butch chooses: a samurai sword. The samurai are long-associated with honour towards their masters. If you want to simplify the overarching theme of the film, you could say it's about honor among thieves. There is also a clue to why Butch saves Marsellus, in the flashback scene with Christopher Walken's Captain Koons, and the young Butch. In the scene, Koons is relating his imprisonment with Butch's father, and tells Butch \"Hopefully, you'll never have to experience this yourself, but when two men are in a situation like me and your dad were, for as long as we were, you take on certain responsibilities of the other\". It's possible that these words came to Butch's mind as he was attempting to leave the pawn shop."], ["Why not just let Jules and Vincent take showers in Jimmy's bathroom to get cleaned up?", "The entire reason Winston was sent to deal with \"The Bonnie Situation\" was because he's an incredibly efficient cleaner. Jimmy was already furious with Jules and Vincent for bringing a blood-soaked car with a dead body in the back seat to his house. Jules points out that Jimmy was incredibly close to kicking them out as it was, while Jules wouldn't allow that to happen before Marvin had been dealt with, he didn't want it to reach that point, as Jimmy was his friend. Winston was looking for the fastest way to get Vincent and Jules cleaned up, as well as get rid of any trace they were ever there before Jimmy's wife Bonnie arrived home from her night shift, while also trying to appease Jimmy's disapproval of the entire situation he had been put in. Had they taken turns in the shower, this would take up a significant amount of time. As the average male spends approximately 10 minutes in the shower, having to scrub the blood and brains off possibly extending this time to 15-20 minutes each. That's 30-40 minutes total, as well as making a bloody mess in the tub which would have to be cleaned, using up even more time, (keep in mind the car had to be cleaned as well). Also, it may have raised suspicion with Bonnie to arrive home to find the shower had been cleaned first thing in the morning, which could lead to her questioning Jimmy, which he risks being caught in a lie. The most efficient and safe method was to have them strip naked in the back yard and hose them both down at the same time. Any remaining blood and brain matter that was sprayed off of them could easily be washed away with the hose and Bonnie wouldn't be the wiser."], ["Why does Butch choose the samurai sword over all the other weapons?", "The overarching theme of the movie is retaining one's honor in the face of adversity. Butch was going to skip town and go on the run from Marsellus BUT he realizes that leaving Marsellus to be raped and/or worse by Maynard and Zed was dishonorable. When he selects a weapon (claw hammer, baseball bat, chain saw) they're all pretty messy things to use as weapons. The sword is associated with samurai, a position of honor in feudal Japan. Also, the sword is literally longer and more deadly than any of the other weapons he sifts through before he finds it. It's unlikely that Butch is an experienced user of the sword but he was also counting on surprise; Butch wouldn't have to get as close to Maynard or Zed to use it and risk them being able to counterattack very easily. The hammer isn't very practical because it doesn't have much striking distance. The chain saw has a very short blade and starting it would have quickly alerted Maynard and Zed giving them plenty of reaction time. And the bat has the length but Butch would risk a non-fatal injury that one of the guys could bounce back from. Look at the fear on Zed's face when Butch taunts him to pick up his pistol. Zed knows that Butch could easily cut his hand off in one stroke or injure him enough to land a second stroke and kill him then."], ["Which book is Vincent reading?", "The book is the first Modesty Blaise novel, which tracks the adventures of female spy Modesty Blaise. Though not of general reference to anything in the movie, it could be noted that Modesty is of some comparable significance to Mia's earlier mentions of \"Fox Force Five,\" a show about a group of female spies. The edition Vincent reads has a mock-up cover that Tarantino had his prop department make, based upon the cover of an early edition of the novel."], ["How could Mia have OD'd?", "Mia is a cocaine user, and when she sees the heroin in Vincent's coat pocket, she just assumes that it is cocaine--it's a white powder in a plastic baggie, and it looks just like coke. The problem is that, when Vincent goes to Lance's house to score heroin, Lance informs him he is out of balloons and asks if a baggie would be all right. (Heroin is usually stashed by dealers in balloons, not baggies, most likely to avoid situations just like this! It is also put in balloons so if you are caught with it or need to safely transport it you can swallow it quickly then \"retrieve\" it later. Mia might have known the difference IF Lance had been able to use a balloon.) The heroin he purchases is also described by Lance as being extremely potent (a \"mad man\"). Heroin is a depressant, whereas cocaine is a stimulant, the most likely reason for the overdose. Fortunately, Vincent gets her to Lance's house in time to save her with the adrenaline shot. (The whole heroin/cocaine mix-up is foreshadowed in Lance's comments to Vince, \"Coke is dead as... dead. Heroin is coming back in a big way.\")"], ["What does The Wolf mean when he tells Jules & Vincent \"...you've both been in county before, I'm sure, here it comes!\" before he opens up with the hose?", "He's teasing them about being arrested and put into county lockup i.e. jail. As they are career criminals, it's a safe bet they've been arrested at some point in the past, probably more than once. In county lockup, you are \"processed\" before standing trial which means that you're given an opportunity to get cleaned up to be more presentable for court. So, depending on the county you're locked up in, you might be sprayed with a hose by the staff after you strip down or you might get a chance to take a shower with cold water. Winston was giving them both a hard time about their past experience -- and given his joking nature, probably enjoying it."], ["What was Vincent's problem with Butch at the bar?", "Vince was having a very bad morning! He was almost killed by a man who was shooting at him, then he accidentally shot Marvin in the face while they were driving, which made a mess of the car, him & Jules, Jules gives Vincent a hard time over it despite it being an accident, had to \"take shit\" from The Wolf, Jules and Jimmy; he had to help Jules clean up all the brains, blood and skull that used to be Marvin's head and Jules forces him to take the messier part of cleaning up the car; he had to strip down naked and get hosed down with freezing cold water in order to clean the blood off himself; he had to wear dorky clothes given to him by Jimmy, and finally he was caught in the middle of a Mexican stand-off at the diner when he and Jules went to breakfast. To top it all off, his best friend and partner (Jules) had just decided to quit the business they were in. This was all in the span of about 3 or 4 hours. So Vince finally shows up at his destination, then gets teased by Paul the bartender about his taking Mia out to dinner, when Butch came up to the bar. Vince probably knew or assumed why Butch was at the bar -- Marsellus was paying him to take a dive. Vincent may not respect people who are willing to betray their principles for money. So when Butch asked if he was looking at something, Vince took the opportunity to insult him."], ["What did Vince call Butch when they were at the bar?", "Vincent called Butch \"Palooka,\" a reference to a cartoon character named Joe Palooka, who was portrayed in a long-running comic series as a heavyweight boxing champion. In Vincent's eyes, \"Palooka\" would be a derogatory term for boxers in general, implying he looked down on Butch for his profession. It's also a fairly popular euphemism from the 1950s to refer to anyone who appears oafish or dumb. Butch is obviously NOT either but it was a convenient insult for Vincent to use. After Butch asks \"What was that?\" Vincent says \"I think you heard me just fine, Punchy,\" obviously another crack at Butch's profession, because the term \"punchy\" when referring to boxers is a word used to describe a boxer who has been in the game too long and has been punched too much and it shows."], ["What's the deal with the guy in black?", "That's \"The Gimp,\" an extreme sexual submissive who is apparently kept prisoner in Maynard and Zed's basement. The character was Roger Avary's idea, who was inspired by _Deliverance (1972)_ (qv). Unfortunately, nothing is specified about the character's origin or the circumstances of his time in the basement, except that he has no apparent desire to be freed. Another character named \"Russell\" once inhabited the same room. The screenplay implies that Russell was a previous prisoner whom Maynard and Zed eventually killed. The text commentary on the _Pulp Fiction_ (qv) Special Edition DVD is similarly vague. It only refers to the Gimp a few times, and calls Butch the \"victim of violence\" and the Gimp the \"perpetrator of violence.\""], ["Why does Marsellus have a Band-Aid on the back of his neck?", "One theory is that it was covering the hole where the \"devil's helpers,\" Brett and gang, stole Marsellus's soul, a longstanding interpretation of the film that has made its rounds among fans since the film was released. However, there is a more mundane explanation. Ving Rhames just happened to have a real-life cut. There is a large scar visible on the back of Ving Rhames' head in all of his later films exactly where the band-aid was. It was possible that he recently had surgery in that area, and instead of covering it with make-up or showing it to the viewing audience (thus confusing them, as it wouldn't have been in the script and therefore never explained), they decided to just cover it with a band-aid. Another theory is that Ving Rhames may have cut himself severely when he was shaving his head."], ["Are \"_Pulp Fiction_ (qv)\" and \"Reservoir Dogs\" connected?", "Yes, and in several ways: (1) Vincent from _Pulp Fiction_ (qv) and Vic \"Mr. Blonde\" Vega ('Michael Madsen' (qv)) from Reservoir Dogs are brothers.

He was swallowed by the Sarlacc after Han accidentally activated his jetpack and he bounced off Jabba's sail barge. According to the Expanded Universe (particularly the Star Wars anthology novels Tales from Jabba's Palace and Tales of the Bounty Hunters), he managed to \"blast\" his way out from under the sand and was discovered by another bounty hunter, #Dengar# (qv) (from The Empire Strikes Back and among those commissioned to find the Millennium Falcon), who saw fit to help Boba recover from extensive injuries sustained in the Sarlacc. However, the scene was originally written to be his death scene and, for the purposes of the film, he is as dead as a doornail or will be after 1,000 years of slow digestion.\n\n'George Lucas' (qv) actually stated on the audio commentary on the DVD that he regretted Boba's fate, as he learned only after the movie how popular a cult figure the bounty hunter had become in the years between Empire and Jedi. Had 'Lucas' (qv) known that when writing Return of the Jedi's screenplay, he would have given Fett a more heroic exit. He even contemplated adding, in the Special Edition, a scene of Boba Fett crawling out of the pit again, but decided to focus on the main narrative instead. So in a way, it can be said that the fate 'Lucas' (qv) intended for Fett has changed over time, which may provide an opportunity for his return in the upcoming Star Wars sequels.\n\nIn the new canon novel Aftermath, a scene features a character using Mandalorian armor with minor acid burns on it. That could very well have been the armor belonging to Boba Fett, which is a good argument for him being alive in the new canon."], ["Is Leia a Jedi Knight in this film?", "No. Although Leia proved her strength and courage in this film during several battle scenes, she has had no actual Jedi training; even though she has the potential to be a Jedi Knight, like Luke states, \"You have that power, too. In time, you'll learn to use it as I have\", implying he would train her. In the old Expanded Universe, the \"Legends\", Leia does indeed receive training and becomes a full-fledged Jedi Master many years later. This however is not apparent in the chronological sequel, The Force Awakens, and furthermore in the new expanded universe, her reasons for being this way are explained via the novel Bloodlines, which retcons the idea that she receives any Jedi training after the Battle of Endor."], ["Why does Yoda state that Luke does not require more training? Did Yoda not object to Luke leaving in the previous movie?", "A Jedi's training consists of more than lightsaber lessons, physical training and education in Force control; as every Padawan (an individual undergoing Jedi training) had to complete the Jedi Trials in order to become a Jedi Knight. In old times, these trials were often done inside areas of the Jedi Temple, where the Force would create physical and mental challenges, which tested the candidate's skills, knowledge and determination. Luke faces one of such trials in the cave on Dagobah, where his mind creates Darth Vader as manifestation of his fear, indicating that he is still not in control of the Force.\n\nThere are special circumstances in which a Padawan has already proven himself in the field more than enough to earn him the level of Jedi Knight. In The Phantom Menace, Obi-Wan Kenobi was ready for the trials according to Qui-Gon Jinn, but he was given the title after defeating a fully-trained Sith Lord almost single-handedly. In the animated micro-series _Star Wars: Clone Wars_ (qv) (an interquel to Episodes II and III), Anakin Skywalker earned his title after single-handedly defending an outpost against the Separatists. Yoda and Ben already knew that Luke would not yet be able to defeat Darth Vader, and they feared that he would also be unable to resist the dark side of the Force. However, Luke managed to resist Vader's temptations.\n\nSo, despite Luke's unfortunate choice to leave his training early, this may have been considered a successfully completed Jedi Trial. Luke had also made himself a new lightsaber (having lost Anakin's old one during his duel with Darth Vader in the Cloud City), another test necessary in order to become a Jedi Knight. According to 'Lucas' (qv), the ability to create one's own functional lightsaber is one of the last trials toward becoming a Jedi because of the high level of control over the Force, which is necessary to maneuver the crystals that make up the major components of a lightsaber. The slightest miscalculation will cause the lightsaber to explode when first activated. Vader confirms this later after realizing that Luke has constructed a new lightsaber, and he states that Luke's skills are complete because of this accomplishment. Yoda concluded that Luke's training was indeed complete, and there was little more he could learn from him: all that stood in the way of Luke becoming a Jedi Knight was a final confrontation with Vader, the hope being that Luke would bring Anakin back from the dark side.\n\nAlso take into account that Yoda was dying and could not exactly leave Luke with the impression that he was not fully trained. This would cause Luke to doubt himself when he most needed confidence."], ["Was Leia originally intended to be who she is revealed to be in this film?", "If by \"originally\" you mean since the very first draft, no. The earliest draft has General Luke Skywalker as an aging Jedi Master, while Anakin Starkiller is his apprentice. Anakin has a father, Kane Starkiller, and a brother, Deak Starkiller, who is killed by Vader early in the film. The Starkillers live on Utapau (which would eventually appear in the third prequel, Revenge of the Sith. Princess Leia, on the other hand, is the biological daughter of King Kayos and Queen Breha of Aquilae. Her brothers in this draft are Biggs and Windom.\n\nIn the second draft, Princess Leia has little more than a cameo. The biography The Cinema of 'George Lucas' (qv) describes Leia as the niece of Owen and his wife Beru, and the sister to Biggs, Windy and Luke, who live on the planet Utapau. Deak is not killed. Instead, he is the character held captive by the Empire. Luke and Annikin have been merged into a single character, Luke Starkiller. Biggs and Windy are now the youngest of the Starkiller siblings. Their father is simply known as Starkiller. The droids find Owen, having been instructed by Deak that he will lead them to \"Angel Blue\" (Luke). The most interesting note about this draft is that it is Luke's brother who takes Leia's place as the Empire's captive. It would seem at this point that Leia had become Luke's sister; however, by the following draft, this would be reversed again. (Interestingly, in the book The Making of Star Wars: The Definitive Story Behind the Original Film, this draft is described with an important difference: Leia is named as Luke's cousin. Therefore, her role in the second draft is not completely certain.)\n\nIn the third draft, Leia is from Ogana Major, and from all indications she is the biological daughter of their royal family. In the fourth draft, Ogana Major became Alderaan, and a slightly modified version of the original planet name, \"Organa\", became Leia's last name. The first draft of The Empire Strikes Back features a brief appearance by the ghost of Luke's father, who tells Luke that he has a sister who is undergoing Jedi training on the other side of the galaxy. Based on this description, the sister in question is clearly not Leia. At one point, 'Lucas' (qv) claims to have considered making the principal character a female (some early production art reflects this direction) but eventually decided to keep both \"versions\" of the character as siblings."], ["If Padm\u00e9 died giving birth to the twins in the prequel trilogy, why does Leia have memories of her mother, whilst Luke does not?", "Some people consider this as a major plot hole, whilst, in reality, they did not read too deeply into the mysticism of the films. As it has been suggested that whilst Luke and Vader can sense each other as father and son, it is entirely plausible that Leia inherited feelings and images from her mother, in a sense creating a mother and daughter symmetry to the male-dominated world of the Jedi. Remember that Leia's dialogue mentions \"images\" and \"feelings\" as opposed to witnessing events. Yoda does tell Luke that through the Force he could see \"old friends long gone.\" It also should be remembered that while they appear human, these characters come from \"a galaxy far, far away\" and would not necessarily have the same mental development as an Earth-born human.\n\nIt is also possible Leia is not referring to Padm\u00e9 at all, as she could be referring to Senator Bail Organa's wife. She grew up thinking the Organas were her biological parents, which could be why Leia remembers \"images\" of her mother. However, this is clearly not the intended meaning of the scene, as Luke does specifically ask Leia \"Do you remember your mother? Your real mother?\" Leia does not react with surprise at the term \"real,\" which would certainly suggest that she knew at that point that she was adopted, and understood to whom Luke was referring.\n\nThe Revenge of the Sith novelization also adds an interesting twist to the whole \"How can Leia remember Padm\u00e9?\" issue. It states that, after Leia's birth she \"stared intently in Padm\u00e9's direction, as if she wanted to memorize her face.\" One can assume that it is meant to be implied that this is how she is able to remember Padm\u00e9 later in life. Why would she be able to remember something from when she was just seconds old, though? Most likely the Force helped her retain the memory. Of course, the account in the novelization of Leia staring at Padm\u00e9 also raises the question of why this was not the case in the movie. Although the filmmakers most likely would have liked to have something like that in the movie, keep in mind that they were shooting with a very young baby (it is inferred in the commentary that the baby they were using for the scenes was not more than a few months old), and infants basically behave in a manner not subject to instruction or direction.\n\nIn the canon Princess Leia comic mini-series set between A New Hope and The Empire Strikes Back, Leia visits Naboo on a mission to rescue survivors of Alderaan who were off world during the planet's destruction. She sees a relief of Padm\u00e9 on a wall and expresses a strange familiarity with it, which implies she may have had knowledge of Padm\u00e9 through these Force visions."], ["Why does the Emperor want Luke to take Vader's place?", "The most important reason is that the Emperor craves power. Vader was older, and is eventually defeated by Luke. Clearly he has lost his effectiveness in combat and likely in the natural intuition that a Jedi or Sith possesses, so a younger apprentice who is just as\u2014if not more\u2014powerful than Vader would prove advantageous to the Emperor.\n\nAnother, lesser known reason which is not addressed in the movies, but stated in many novelizations, is that Vader's ability to use the Force was greatly reduced upon suffering the injuries which confined him to his survival suit. Therefore, Luke, being the son of Anakin, one of the most powerful Jedi known, would definitely be more powerful, inheriting his father's abilities and with the training he received from Yoda. As 'Lucas' (qv) states in the \"Making of\" book for the third prequel, Revenge of the Sith, the Emperor \"will ultimately be disappointed in Anakin,\" and will eventually see Luke (and possibly Leia) as an opportunity to obtain a more powerful apprentice.\n\nA third reason which can tie in with the first two is that the Sith habitually follow or are afflicted by \"the Rule of Two\", a name given to a concept expounded upon by Yoda at the end of the first prequel, The Phantom Menace: \"Always two there are, no more, no less: a master and an apprentice.\" This is due to a Sith Lord's extreme inclination to be possessive of other individuals amidst having obsession with power; and due to competition and betrayal accordingly. (The value that anybody has to a Sith Lord cannot be peacefully shared with a third party.) To have Luke and Vader as his apprentices, especially considering they were father and son, would definitely increase the chance that they would betray and kill the Emperor. Vader even proposes this idea to Luke, in The Empire Strikes Back, though that could have just been a ruse to coax Luke to the dark side of the Force, promising him secondary rule of the galaxy. He also suggests overthrowing the Emperor to his wife, in Revenge of the Sith, and ruling the galaxy with her, which was only shortly after he had turned to the dark side.\n\nAlso (in the Expanded Universe), the Rule of Two involves a provision of which the Emperor was not fond. As the story goes, the Rule of Two came about after thousands of years of the Sith being in power. The Dark Lords of the Sith were vast and there was an unspoken tradition within their ranks that the apprentices would at some point try and kill their masters. Eventually this imploded and the Sith all but destroyed themselves due to the constant paranoia and scheming between masters and apprentices. Eventually, around 1,000 years before the events of the Star Wars plots, the Sith Darth Bane initiated the Rule of Two allowing only one master and one apprentice. The idea being that after the apprentice's training was complete, he would challenge his master in open combat. If the apprentice won the duel, he would strike down his master and claim the title for himself, then find his own apprentice. On the flip-side, if the apprentice lost the duel, he was unworthy of the title of Sith Master, and the master would find a replacement; the idea being that no matter what, the Sith would always become stronger with each master and apprentice. Clearly the Emperor was not fond of Bane's idea, because he manipulated Anakin/Vader in such a way that Vader never found a sincere motivation to overthrow the Emperor after it was thought that his wife and his child were killed. Vader's only desire was to become more powerful through the dark side of the Force. So the Emperor only gave him small bits of training over the years to keep Vader enticed. The Emperor then gets Vader and Luke to duel each other, the victor being intended to be the Emperor's apprentice."], ["What are the black blobs seen around spaceships in several shots?", "These are hand-drawn garbage mattes. A garbage matte represents a technique of blotting out unwanted areas of a shot, such as the greyish boxes appearing around spacecraft in some scenes, where the matte was used to cut out mounting pylons for the models and other areas not covered by blue screen. In a theatrical presentation, these garbage mattes are generally invisible because of the high contrast of motion picture film; however, the lower range of colors and grayscale supported by home video standards often causes these special effects artifacts to show up when viewed on disc or VHS versions."], ["If the Emperor orchestrated everything, such as allowing the Rebels to know the location of the shield generator etc., then how is it the Rebels still succeeded?", "In the end (as Luke said), his overconfidence was the Emperor's weakness. Even with all his meticulous planning, the one thing he did not expect was for the tiny, primitive, and (in his opinion) insignificant native creatures of Endor's moon, called Ewoks, to assist the \"insignificant\" Rebels in capturing the base and ambushing the Imperial stormtroopers, and he may very well have been completely unaware of their presence at all. If the Ewoks had not been there, or had not helped the Rebels' infantry, the stormtroopers would likely have wiped out the small group of Rebel soldiers. The shield generator would have remained operational, preventing the Death Star from being attacked, and the Rebel fleet would have been defenseless against the Death Star's weapon. The Rebel-Ewok alliance allowed the Rebels to destroy the shield generator and attack the internal structure of the Death Star.\n\nEven if the Emperor's plan had succeeded, Luke would have refused to join the dark side after defeating Vader. In the Emperor's infinite arrogance, he also let his guard down near Vader, not expecting Vader to throw him over the ledge of the reactor shaft, killing him. So even if the Rebel Alliance had been destroyed, the Emperor likely would not have lived long enough to reap the rewards.\n\nWhen Luke refused to fight Vader, the Rebels were losing, but when he confronted him and refused loyalty to the Emperor, the tide of the battle changed. Luke was perhaps representing the understated light side of the Force, in the battle between the dark side of the Force and this light side\u2014\"the good side.\" Had Luke lost or joined the dark side; going by the mystique aspect, the dark side and the Empire (the latter representing the former) would have gained the upper hand and defeated the Rebels. In some of the Expanded Universe, some very powerful Jedi have an ability called \"battle meditation\". They can sit in a room and meditate while a fierce battle rages, be it on land or in outer space. When meditating, certain Jedi can influence their allies fighting the battle into having faster reflexes, foresight, etc. So if Luke truly was so powerful; once he embraced the light side (or at the very least, rejected the dark side), he may have influenced the Rebellion's success without even knowing it. The Emperor, with whom the Force was strong, may have been very adept at battle meditation and likely assumed that his own ability to carry it out far surpassed Luke's, again reinforcing how arrogant he had become throughout his career."], ["Didn't Lando Calrissian originally die at the end of \"Jedi\"?", "No. The story that Lando originally died and had his fate altered to survive after disastrous test screenings is an urban legend. In no released version of the script does he die (nor in \"The Annotated Screenplays\"), and both Jedi writer 'Lawrence Kasdan' (qv) and Lando actor 'Billy Dee Williams' (qv) have dismissed this rumour. The IGN review of the Star Wars Trilogy box set is incorrect in saying that Lando originally did not make it out in time when Death Star exploded. There were never any test screenings of the film. However, 'Harrison Ford' (qv) did strongly argue with 'Lucas' (qv) that his character, Han Solo, should die, quoting himself as having said, \"He's got no momma, no poppa. Let's kill him off and add some weight to this thing.\" 'Lucas' (qv) denied Ford his request, preferring to let Han live and have the story end on a much happier note. (In the subsequent novels and other writings of the Expanded Universe; Han and Leia marry and have three children, twins Jaina and Jacen as well as one younger boy, Anakin.)"], ["Why didn't Vader ever seem to sense through the Force that Leia was his daughter? After all, he could sense that Luke was his son!", "He didn't necessarily sense that Luke was his son. Regardless, the easiest (and probably the most likely) explanation for this one is that, as far as he knew, his wife\u2014Padm\u00e9\u2014had been pregnant with only one baby and that baby had died with her. (By the tale end of the third prequel, Revenge of the Sith, he was unaware that the baby had successfully been born before Padm\u00e9's death). He later deduced, of course, that Luke was his son, and realized that \"the baby\" had successfully been born before Padm\u00e9's death. But because he was never aware that Padm\u00e9 had given birth to twins, he would not have had any reason to suspect that he had another child. Vader did not realize Luke was his son until sometime after the events of A New Hope. In Return of the Jedi, he does not realize Leia is his daughter until perhaps during his duel with Luke, when, as Luke was hiding, Vader sensed his thoughts and became aware that Luke has a sister that Obi-Wan had hidden from the Sith. Another reason is that; although the Force is strong with Leia, she is no Jedi and has never learned to control the Force. When trying to shoot down Luke in the Battle of Yavin, in A New Hope, Vader could sense that the Force was strong with the Rebel pilot. After learning that Luke's surname is \"Skywalker\" as Darth Vader's once was, he must have concluded that the boy must be his offspring. As Leia's surname is Organa, she is supposed to be Bail Organa's daughter, and she has no Force powers that Vader can detect. So he has no reason whatsoever to suspect that she might be his daughter."], ["What exactly were the steps in Palpatine's plot in this film?", "Step 1: Palpatine, the Emperor, had commissioned construction on a new Death Star some time before the events in this film, and perhaps shortly after the start of the first.\n\nStep 2: The Emperor allows the Rebel Alliance to discover that the new Death Star is being built and is also being protected by a deflector shield generator present on the forest moon that the Death Star orbits of the remote planet Endor. He likely also allows the fact, that he will be personally overseeing the final stages of construction, to be leaked, so as to draw out as much of the core leadership of the Alliance (including #Mon Mothma# (qv)) as possible.\n\nStep 3: The Emperor places an entire legion of his elite troops on the Endor's forest moon, the Sanctuary Moon, to ambush the Rebels sent to destroy the shield generator (likely some time before sending Vader to the Death Star to \"motivate\" its crew to get the battle station's signature weapon, the superlaser, operational).\n\nStep 4: Aboard the Death Star, as the Emperor awaits the Rebel attack, Vader comes and informs him that Luke is on the Sanctuary Moon. Vader is then instructed to bring Luke before the Emperor, in order for them to work together to turn Luke to the dark side of the Force.\n\nStep 5: As Luke resists the urge to angrily attempt an assassination of the Emperor, he is informed by the Emperor that elaborate traps for the Rebels on the Sanctuary Moon and for the Rebels assaulting the Death Star have been set, which would result in the entire Rebellion being wiped out in one fell swoop. The Emperor's goading is successful, and a duel between Luke and Vader is incited.\n\nStep 6: After Luke defeats Vader in a lightsaber duel, the Emperor orders Luke to finish Vader and take Vader's place at the Emperor's side. Once Luke refuses, the Emperor tries to kill him but fails. In his arrogance and being distracted with immense fury (as his whole plot has been foiled), he did not expect Vader to save Luke by throwing the Emperor over a railing into the reactor shaft, ending the reign of Palpatine."], ["Is the dark side of the Force stronger than the light side?", "For the most part, yes. Although there is never an explicit mention of a \"light side\" of the Force in the movies; it is the expected name for what constitutes the opposite of the dark side of the Force. The easiest analogy to make, is if one was to say become a bodybuilder. To do it the Jedi way would mean eating the proper diet, grueling and painful hard work, and strict discipline. To do it the dark side way would mean using steroids. A lot of the principals and dedication are more or less the same, however using the dark side of the Force involves less work to attain the same potential and therefore less discipline in the use of the powers, which can ultimately lead to the user's own demise. Remember what Yoda says in The Empire Strikes Back when Luke asks him this very question. Yoda tells Luke that the dark side is \"quicker, easier, more seductive.\"\n\n'George Lucas' (qv) has confirmed the dark side is indeed stronger on numerous occasions. He says the dark side is more powerful in the DVD commentary for A New Hope. In The Empire Strikes Back, Luke asked Yoda if the dark side is stronger. Yoda contends that the polarities are evenly matched in strength but that the dark side is easier and quicker to obtain the power it specifically provides. Yoda says this because the Jedi look at the dark side as nothing more than a shortcut and since you have to actually be a Sith and be trained in the Sith arts to understand the dark side's full potential, the Jedi Order does not believe that the dark side is superior. In the second prequel, Attack of the Clones, Yoda confronts Count Dooku and seems to acknowledge the awesome might of the dark side, stating, \"Powerful you have become, Dooku. The dark side I sense in you.\"\n\nThe dark side is easy and stronger but is also very dangerous for the user and not worth the risk of a easy way to power. The dark side gives a lot, but it takes much much more. However, it is still more alluring because it is more easily obtained and offers powerful abilities such as Force lighting, which is a power that is almost exclusively a privilege of practitioners of the dark side of the Force.\n\nThe ultimate reason why the dark side is more powerful is because it is fueled by intense, aggressive emotions such as hate, anger, fear, sadness, possessiveness and lust for power. At the same time this is also why the dark side will eventually lose, because its users will never become united but rather they will always be at war with one another, fighting for supremacy. In short, although not as powerful as the dark side, the light side will always prevail because the Sith's lust for power and their inward thinking of only about themselves will always ultimately be their undoing.\n\nIt may be too that the dark side has much more of a corporeal foundation than the light side, in that practitioners of the dark side seek immortality through life extension in the \"crude matter\" of their worldly bodies, rather than through becoming \"one with the Force\" and living on as immortal spirits, perhaps \"luminous beings,\" whose interactions with the physical world are quite limited. Furthermore, Jedi might not even represent the light side until they actually vaporize into spirits, instead being neutral; unlike the Sith, who definitely represent the dark side of the Force."], ["How could the Emperor expect Luke to turn to the dark side of the Force?", "The Emperor wanted to break Luke's humanity, by having the young Jedi commit patricide in a fit of rage thus succumbing to darkness. The Emperor could then somehow claim that, with Darth Vader out of the way, Luke's new power would be the way for Luke to save his own friends (including his sister), but the Emperor would have to make enormous concessions in order to gain Luke's allegiance. They both or Luke alone could figure that in order to keep Leia from the dark side, it would be wise to stay away from her.\n\nWhile the Emperor would have no guarantee of Luke's personal loyalty, Luke would remain for a time dependent upon the Emperor for the safety of his friends. If Luke would be cooperative, the Emperor could try negotiating a d\u00e9tente with the Rebels and pardoning them of their offenses. Whereas if Luke would be combative, the Emperor could not only destroy the Rebels along with Endor's forest moon but also do egregious harm to Luke, rendering him handicapped in the same manner as Darth Vader.\n\nIn the meantime, unless the Emperor had any more tricks up his sleeve or other skills with the Force, he would have no way to prevent the Death Star's deflector shield generator from being destroyed and furthermore little way of preventing the attack upon the the Death Star itself. However, in being jammed and busy engaging the Imperial capitol ships, apparently the attacking Rebel starfighters' pilots' way of knowing the status of the Death Star's deflector shields was through information conveyed through the Rebel capitol ships, the retreat (or destruction) of which could have warranted abortion of the mission altogether. (Upon Han's success, the Admiral of the Rebel fleet told them, \"The shield is down! Commence attack on the Death Star's main reactor!\" Whereas before, when the Death Star's superlaser was first discovered to be operational, he ordered his staff to have \"all craft prepare to retreat\", arguing, \"Our cruisers can't repel firepower of that magnitude.\") From a metaphysical standpoint, the Imperial forces' performance was contingent upon the success of the dark side of the Force, albeit the success of their lord.\n\nAt this point in the saga, though; with the Jedi being no more, destruction of the Death Star might not have constituted a significant loss to the Emperor. He would have satisfied the primary directives of the Sith Order, if the last Jedi or Padawan had abandoned the Jedi way once and for all by either turning or dying."], ["What are these Bothans that died bringing the important information to the Rebel leaders?", "The Bothans are a sapient species whose homeworld is likely host to a society (and regime) likely secretly aligned with the Rebellion, much like how Admiral Ackbar's kind (Mon Calamari) and Lando's copilot's kind (Sullustan) work with/for the Rebels. They are supposedly renown for their foreign intelligence apparatus. The story of the Bothan spies is covered in the old Expanded Universe novel Shadows of the Empire, by Steve Perry, written and published (as part of a media subfranchise) over a decade after Return of the Jedi was originally released (while leading right into the years of the Special Edition releases and the first Star Wars prequel). The story takes place after the events of The Empire Strikes Back.\n\nIn the novel, the principal antagonist, Prince Xizor, as a close associate of the Emperor, becomes aware of a starfreighter transporting a highly important computer core. Being the leader of a major organized crime syndicate, Xizor directs the syndicate look into the matter. Both belonging to the underworld, the syndicate tips off the Bothan Spynet about the shipment. The Bothan spymaster seeks out the help of Luke for capturing the starfreighter, while providing Luke with a group of Bothan pilots. With the help of a smuggler named Dash Rendar (piloting the Outrider), an ace fighter pilot named Ace Azzameen (piloting a Y-wing) and a number of additional less skilled Bothan fighter pilots (piloting the same); Luke (piloting an X-wing) leads an attack upon the target starfreighter which turns out to have a secret weapon. Around half of the Bothan squadron winds up being destroyed by the target's defense systems, before the target is suitable for being raided and captured. Only Dash and several Bothan combatants board the starfreighter and secure the computer, the information within which later makes its way to the Rebel Alliance High Command (just as the Emperor planned), but even more Bothans including the spymaster wind up being killed, this time by bounty hunters looking for Luke, along the way."], ["How does the movie end?", "When the Emperor orders Luke to kill Darth Vader and join him on the Dark Side, Luke refuses, claiming that he is a Jedi, like his father before him.

The principle reason for this change comes down to Anakin's choices in Sith. 'Lucas' (qv) is making the statement that when Anakin became Darth Vader, Anakin's Jedi spirit was lost. That spirit now appears to Luke in this younger form because Luke has allowed Anakin to fulfill his prophecy and regain his former identity, which takes the physical shape and form that it had before he turned to the dark side of the Force. If image of the old man was retained; it should honestly, considering Anakin's human injuries, be scarred, limbless and deformed. The reason is also possibly because Shaw might appear to be too old in the scene, since Anakin is 46 years old by the end of the film, according to the series' official timeline.\n\nIn the canon Darth Vader comic book series, there is an inner psychological battle going on in Vader's mind between his present \"Dark Side\" self, and what little \"good\" is left in him representing the \"Light Side\" and the man he once was.

It was prophesied by the Oracle that his coming would hail the destruction of the Matrix and bring freedom to the human race. Morpheus is convinced that Neo is that man, although others, Neo included, are not so sure. As explained by the Architect in the second movie, ]the \"one\" is a program anomaly that the Matrix could not account for; an anomaly that occurs because humans have to be given a choice (if the only an illusion of such) in order to accept the virtual world the machines have created for them. Doing so creates the anomaly that is 'The One'. According to the Architect, there were 5 predecessors to the current \"One\". Once Neo reaches the Architect, he is told of the choice of the One: to choose a certain number of humans to repopulate Zion and start all over again, or to choose to let Zion fall and cause the mutual destruction of both, the machines and the humans. The One is basically a real world reset switch. There are those in the Matrix that will never fully accept the machines' reality, and they will find ways to leave the Matrix for the human city of Zion. Once the free human population of Zion grows too large, it poses a threat to the machines; therefore the \"One\" is reintroduced to the Matrix to restart the cycle. Once the One meets the Architect, he is given a choice: to return to the source in order to save humanity and rebuild Zion (thus starting a new cycle and bringing balance as prophesied), or to choose to stay in the Matrix, thereby assuring the destruction of both species.

Cypher casually but quickly turns off several screens, including three that have real time imagery instead of the Matrix code. This is likely so the inquisitive Neo wouldn't ask him about it."], ["Why did the Oracle tell Neo that he wasn't the One?", "The Oracle ('Gloria Foster' (qv)) never explicitly tells Neo that he is not The One.

It's a lesson for Neo, to help him realize that manipulating the Matrix isn't about focusing on an object and trying to change it.

In the Source the Architect resides. The Architect is the machine program that created the Matrix. The Architect apparently keeps a close watch on Neo, and the reason for this is that Neo is a complex and intricate part in the Machines' ploy to keep the humans subdued."], ["How come Apoc and Switch died when Cypher unplugged them?", "\"The body cannot live without the mind.\" Somehow, the mind/consciousness leaves when they get plugged in, and one needs a proper 'hard-line' (data path) to get back in properly. It's likely that it forms some sort of data corruption between the user's mind and the Matrix.

The Agents seem to operate collectively, finishing each others' sentences at times and certainly knowing what each is thinking. Smith's actions may largely be symbolic to show that he's able to turn this collective consciousness off and, in this case, has a reason to. His discussion with Morpheus implies that he is much more \"human\" than his colleagues/ He shows frustration, exhaustion, impatience, and hatred of the Matrix itself and his place in it."], ["How does the movie end?", "Pursued in the Matrix by the three Agents, Neo races for the exit at the Heart O' the City Hotel, room 303. The moment he gets inside, however, Agent Smith empties his gun into his chest. Neo slumps to the floor as, back in the Nebuchadnezzar, Trinity, Tank, and Morpheus watch incredulously as Neo's body flatlines. As the Sentinels continue to break through the hull of the ship, Trinity whispers into Neo's ear that the Oracle told her that she would fall in love with the One, so Neo must be the One because 'I love you,' she says and kisses him. Neo suddenly begins to breathe. At the same time, he awakens in the Matrix now knowing that he is, indeed, the One. When the Agents empty their guns at him, he stops the bullets in mid-air. When Agent Smith tries to attack him, Neo easily bests him and takes over his body, killing him. The other two agents run away, and Neo transports back to the ship just as Morpheus orders the electromagnetic pulser (EMP) to be engaged, destroying the attacking Sentinels. In the final scene, as the blank screen fills with system prompts and a grid of numbers, a voiceover by Neo says, 'I know you're out there. I can feel you now. I know that you're afraid... you're afraid of us. You're afraid of change. I don't know the future. I didn't come here to tell you how this is going to end. I came here to tell you how it's going to begin. I'm going to hang up this phone, and then I'm going to show these people what you don't want them to see. I'm going to show them a world without you. A world without rules and controls, without borders or boundaries. A world where anything is possible. Where we go from there is a choice I leave to you.' In the Matrix world, Neo hangs up the phone. He looks at the masses around him, puts on his glasses, looks up, and takes flight."], ["How does Trinity's kiss revive Neo?", "The brain does not die immediately when heart and respiration stops. Neo was almost the One, he'd not been affected by the first bullet, until he saw his blood. So, his mind was almost to the point of disbelieving the illusion of the matrix -- that he should be injured by bullets. He could feel Trinity's kiss or hear her words, somehow, which reminded him that the matrix was not real."], ["Why does Neo see the 3 agents as green code after he comes back to life?", "Now that he truly believes he is the One, Neo is beginning to use some of his power over the Matrix. He can now see the Matrix for what it is, and this will lead to additional abilities to manipulate it as he sees it."], ["Who is Neo talking to on the phone at the end of the movie?", "Neo is talking (possibly metaphorically) to the machine mainframe. He's talking to the Source, to the power behind the machines, to whatever sends the Agents after him. And he's telling it/them that he's done running, that he can defeat them and because of that the best for both sides is that the machines simply stop attacking humanity."], ["How do people have babies in the Matrix?", "Morpheus explains to Neo that babies are not born in the Matrix; they are grown. This suggests that the usual human birth cycle (in utero fertilization and growth followed by birth at term) is not being followed. The most likely methods are by cloning or by harvesting a female's eggs and artificially inseminating them, then placing the embryos in incubation, some of which may be allowed to develop and others of which, as Morpheus also explains, are liquefied as food. As for how do people procreate while connected to the Matrix; it's possible they don't. We never see any pregnant women inside the Matrix, so it's impossible to say for sure. Another possibility is that when the machines grow a new human infant, they pre-program a couple inside the matrix to conceive a child."], ["Why don't the Machines use animals besides humans for energy?", "They need the access to the human mind....it fuels the story line, unlike if this was an animal induced world it would be pretty far behind technologically. Other: ..Based on all available information about the setting of the Matrix movies, the easiest explanation to accept would be that too few animals are left alive after the war between humans and the Machines. However, in 'Matriculated', an episode of _The Animatrix (2003)_ (qv), a monkey named Baby was depicted with functional implants for jacking into simulations, evidence that the Machines could indeed insert some animals into the Matrix. Scientifically, the whole premise that Machines need to harvest human body heat to survive is dubious at best. For one thing, there's no adequate explanation of how the humans are kept alive. (Feeding them the liquid corpses wouldn't be enough.) Furthermore, other forms of fusion would probably prove more efficient. At the Machines' level of technology, solar power could still be an option, despite the sun being blocked off. Fans have proposed some alternate explanations for why people are kept alive in the Matrix. One intriguing idea is that the Machines cannot artificially replicate certain qualities of biological sentience and are secretly using human brains as CPUs. Otherwise, it is conceivable that the human race is being preserved for conservationist, ethical, sadistic, or sentimental reasons."], ["Were the actors martial artists?", "The actors that were hired had some kind of physical background; Carrie Anne-Moss was a dancer and 'Keanu Reeves' (qv) used to play ice hockey. The actors underwent a hard training regimen for several months prior to filming."], ["If the Agents still had control over Neo in the beginning, why didn't one of the Agents just take over Neo's body and effectively kill him?", "It isn't made clear what the rules are for the Agents to take over a person's body, but as shown in the movie, they wanted to use Neo in order to locate Morpheus and kill him and the rest of his group. Originally the agents tried to get Neo to simply agree to help them in order to have his criminal record expunged. When this fails they grab hold of Neo and put a tracking device into his stomach (also possible, given that it had some sort of bio-mechanical function that it could have taken over Neo's body causing him to fall under the control of the machines). To explain why the agents wouldn't take over Neo while Neo was with Morpheus is likely because they likely need to be within a certain radius from Neo. As the tracking device was removed from Neo, the agents didn't know where Neo was and could not take over his body. Also, after the Agents release Neo, Morpheus calls him and says \"They have seriously underestimated how important you are. If they knew what I know; you'd probably be dead.\". So simple naivety or arrogance on part of the machines is likely why they didn't kill him."], ["What are those characters in the green matrix code?", "Japanese katakana numbers and letters mirror-reversed."], ["Why didn't \"_The Matrix_ (qv)\" win any major Oscars?", "Usually, science fiction films rarely even get nominated for the \"majors\" (Best Actor, Best Actress, Best Screenplay, Best Director, Best Picture), and none have ever won. However, _The Matrix_ (qv) did win four Academy Awards in the \"technical categories\" - Sound Effects, Visual Effects, Sound and Editing.

Galadriel, Elrond ('Hugo Weaving' (qv)) and Gandalf each possess one of the Three Rings of the Elves. Gandalf got the Ring of Fire, Narya, from C\u00edrdan, an Elven lord who lives in the Grey Havens. C\u00edrdan in turn received it from Gil-galad. The Ring of Air, Vilya, was originally given to Gil-galad, who later gave it to Elrond. Galadriel possessed the Ring of Adamant, Nenya. They weren't enslaved by Sauron because he wasn't directly involved in their creation; in addition, they stopped using their Rings when they realized Sauron was evil and kept them hidden so he couldn't find them. Seven Rings were given to the Dwarves. They would have become corrupted by Sauron, but they ended up being too stubborn, and Sauron couldn't take control of them. He managed to acquire three of the Seven Dwarven Rings through war, trickery and theft, and the other four were consumed by dragonfire. It is said that, although Sauron couldn't bend the dwarves to his will, he was able to make them greedier and prone to bad decisions (such as trying to resettle Moria) and hoarding the great treasures beneath Erebor instead of sharing them with the other races of Middle Earth."], ["What species is Sauron and what makes him so special that he can create a magical ring that dominates all life in Middle Earth?", "Sauron is a Maia, created as powerful servants for the Valar, the \"gods\" who live in Valinor, the famous West all the characters talk about. He used to be the sidekick of Melkor (Morgoth), the banished Vala, sort of a Middle-earth equivalent of Lucifer/Satan, the most powerful angel turned to evil.

Some are inherently much more powerful than others. Gandalf's strength was primarily that of wisdom rather than of brute force. Also, Gandalf, Saruman, and the other wizards were bound to their mortal form to prevent them from using their full strength to intervene in the affairs of Middle Earth.

Frodo was a virtuous individual and possessed an inner strength recognized by both Elrond and Gandalf, making him the perfect ring-bearer.

But, nobody used the password much, because the doors were always open in friendlier times."], ["Why does Gimli expect his cousin Balin to be in the Mines of Moria?", "As Gandalf explains, the Dwarfs had dug so deep in the mines of Moria that by the year 1980 of the Third Age (1020 years prior to Bilbo's 111th birthday at the start of the movie), they awoke the Balrog, who decimated their numbers. The Mines of Moria were abandoned by the Dwarfs for centuries since, and were occupied by Orcs and other foul things. In the year 2799, a group of Dwarfs (including Balin and Thorin) defeated the Orcs at the eastern gates of Moria (the same place where the Fellowship exits the mines in the movie). However, the Dwarfs dared not enter Moria out of fear for the invincible Balrog. 141 years later, in 2940, they went on another quest; they re-claimed their old kingdom of Erebor, by defeating Smaug the Dragon (as seen in The Hobbit prequels). In 2988, Balin and a contingent of Dwarfs left Erebor to establish a new Dwarf colony in Moria. After a short period of correspondence with their home land, they were never heard from again. Nonetheless, Gimli assumed Balin would still be there with a successful colony to \"give them a royal welcome\", only to find that the mines had been infested by Goblins again, and the Balrog was still there. Because Dwarfs in Tolkien's world live very long (as much as 250 years), visits to see their kin, which are common among humans in our age, weren't as frequent. It may have been decades since Gimli had last seen his cousin and, in the intervening time, Moria was attacked again and its inhabitants killed."], ["Was the Balrog a servant of Sauron or was he independent of the power of Mordor?", "It was likely independent of Sauron. The Balrog was a being of the same order as Gandalf, Saruman and Sauron. If Sauron were to go to Moria the Balrog would probably recognize him.

I thought Ring-bearers did not age.", "The ring does prolong life but ringbearers do age. The rate of their aging appears to be dependent upon the amount of time they are in possession of the ring and the amount of \"harm\" they do when using it. Bilbo used the ring to hide and doesn't seem to have used it all that often in the comparatively short number of years that he had it. Frodo didn't use the ring at all until he started his journey. By comparison, Sm\u00e9agol/Gollum was in possession of the ring for some 500 years and used it to kill Orcs. Consequently, the ring had a greater effect on him than on Bilbo. Bilbo does age much more rapidly after giving up the Ring, however. Though there is a time difference between the book and the film as to when he and Frodo meet again at Rivendell, it is clearly pointed out that Bilbo's advanced age has caught up with him, as is true in the book. At one point, (in both the book and film), when Frodo is visiting with Bilbo in his rooms, the latter asks to see the Ring again and Frodo refuses out of a sense of fear, or possibly even possessiveness. Bilbo suddenly snarls and reaches for the Ring, looking just like Gollum for a second. This pains Bilbo greatly and he apologizes for \"everything\", but also alerts Frodo visually to what might happen to him if he uses the Ring.

In the books, the true Uruk-hai were actually bred by Sauron, to act as elite troops and commanders of the lesser Orcs. Saruman's hybrids of Orcs and Men were referred to as half-orcs; they are described as \"sallow-faced and squint-eyed.\" In the movie, Saruman explains to the Uruk-hai how orcs came to be, that they were ruined Elves, captured and tortured by Sauron. In the Silmarillion, however, it is stated that it was Morgoth, the first Dark Lord who did this. Jackson & his co-writers, Fran Walsh (his wife) and Philippa Boyens, simply took a bit of literary license & created the scene for dramatic effect."], ["Why are there so many different accents in this movie?", "Gandalf and Elrond, and others, come from a different place and, in a sense, a different time. They're meant to speak differently. As for some of the other characters, in the days before mass communication, regional accents varied more. The film glosses over class differences which would be readily understood, e.g., Bilbo and Frodo are of a different social class than Sam. In many places today, your \"gardener\" (or landscaper) would speak as you do and probably send his kids to the same school. In Tolkien's world this would not have been the case. Merry and Pippin are actually in Frodo's social class but they either picked up or affected more \"countryish\" accents."], ["Is it true that there is a car driving by somewhere in the movie?", "Yes and no: it was in the theatrical version of the movie (when Frodo and Sam are walking through the corn fields) but it was deleted in the DVD and VHS editions. While Sam and Frodo are walking in the cornfields right before they meet Merry and Pippin there is a long shot with dust coming from a back road behind them. This is the scene of controversy and, in his commentary, Peter Jackson points out several flaws, but still claims he cannot see this one. The dust plume can be seen in the National Geographic special about the movies. Although it has been suggested the dust rising is merely smoke coming from the chimney of a hobbit-hole in the background, the source end of the dust plume moves across the landscape, suggesting that the source of the dust plume is also moving across the landscape."], ["Why was Tom Bombadil not included in the film?", "Jackson has said that he purposefully left Tom Bombadil out of the film because he felt that Tom's meeting with the travelling hobbits did not advance the story, but rather held it up. It is possible to remove Bombadil from the story completely without affecting any later events. Another factor is that after trying very hard to convince the audience that the Ring corrupts everyone and is dangerous, Tom is seen to be apparently immune, reducing the threat of the Ring. However, in a small nod to Tom Bombadil, Treebeard uses Bombadil's incantation to save Merry and Pippin when they become trapped by the roots of an old tree in Fangorn Forest.\n\nIt is worth noting, however, that after the Hobbits leave Bombadil's home, they must cross a land of \"downs\" (grasslands with hills) that are dotted with \"Barrows\" or underground graves from a much earlier kingdom. Tom warns them away from these structures but they get lost in the fog. He has given them a rhyme to summon them, as if knowing they will get in trouble. A \"Barrow-wight\", a sort of zombie--neither living nor dead--inside the mound, captures them and is about to kill them when Sam wakes up and attacks it. They recite the rhyme and wake up later (after passing out) on the grass, naked. Tom tells them to \"run about\" and clear their heads while he searches for things in the barrow, To show how old he really is, he finds a woman's brooch and reminisces, \"Fair was she who long ago wore this on her shoulder!\", indicating some romantic relationship in the distant past.\n\nBut much more important are the Elvish blades he finds and gives to the Hobbits as swords. Merry's proves a lifesaver and a sword that turns the tide of the Battle of the Pelennor, when he attacks the Witch King of Angmar, who has disabled Eowyn. It turns out that his blade has the power to sever the \"undead sinews\" of the King and banish him from the world of the Living. In the film, it seems to be owyn who does this, since she is \"no man\", but in the book, it is Merry's blade. Both he and the shieldmaiden are sickened by their contact with the Ringwraith, not as badly as Frodo, but in the book, they are taken to the Houses of Healing inside Minas Tirith and healed by Aragorn.

Over the course of his investigation in the film, Jake again tries to protect a woman, and once again, she is killed as a direct result of his intervention. Jake's last line, \"As little as possible\" refers to his earlier conversation with Evelyn, where she asked him what he did as assistant to the District Attorney in _Chinatown_ (qv). His reply was \"as little as possible\", probably referring to the fact that corruption and crime ran so rampant that Jake got the feeling that he did not amount to anything, and may even have inadvertantly helped injustice take place.

When he investigates Oak Pass Reservoir, where Hollis' body was found, he nearly drowns when a large amount of water is drained through the spillway he was hiding in. He confronts Mulwray's successor, Mr Yelburton, with this information, but Yelburton replies that they are curteously diverting some water in order to help orange farmers in the San Fernando Valley, and that some of the water is spilled in the process. However, when Jake goes to the farmers to confirm this story, they tell him that not only is LA's Water & Power Company cutting them off from natural water, they are even sabotaging their few remaining water storage tanks and wells in order to drive them away from the land.\n\nJake later finds out that all the farming land in the Valley that has become worthless due to the draught is bought up cheaply by the people around Noah Cross. Their intention is to re-irrigate the area as soon as they own it all, making the land fertile and valuable again. However, for that, they need the new dam and water reservoir to be built, which requires the approval of the city and a positive vote from the Citizens' Committee. That would only work if there was a genuine water shortage in LA. Apparently, the water company is doing too good a job in stealing water away from the surrounding valleys; so much that they have to illegally dump some of it from time to time to maintain their claim that there is indeed a water shortage. Mulwray was opposed to the new dam and reservoir because he knew that due to the widespread corruption, the new dam would be unsafe and another accident waiting to happen; but another reason for him was that he suspected that the water company was artificially creating a demand for it, and only Noah and his people would profit highly from it.

Cross and Mulwray were already on bad terms: Cross did not like it that Mulwray had de-privatized the water company, whereas Mulwray never forgave Cross for forcing him to approve the building of the first dam that had ruptured and killed hundreds of people; and Mulwray knew about Cross' sordid history with his daughter and granddaughter."], ["What is Noah Cross' ultimate plan?", "Noah's scheme really breaks down into two different schemes:\n\n1.

Noah was denying water to the farmers (and sending out men that worked him to terrorize them: poisoning their wells, blowing up their water tanks) to encourage or coerce them to sell their land, then using the identities of the residents of the retirement home to purchase land at a discount. He would then use his influence and knowledge of the water system to ensure the land would be provided with a supply of fresh water for future residents. Noah and his descendents would be rich.

The ship was officially called USS Indianapolis CA-35, a U.S. Navy heavy cruiser that was torpedoed and sunk in the Pacific Ocean by a Japanese submarine just after midnight on July 30, 1945. (Quint incorrectly states the date as June 29th rather then July 30th.) The loss of over 800 men made it the second worst single ship-loss disaster for the U.S. Navy during the war, behind the battleship USS Arizona at Pearl Harbor (1,177 men) and more than the heavy cruiser USS Juneau (690 men) at Guadalcanal. The story of the ship's crew struggling for five days in the waters of the Pacific Ocean before being rescued is all true. Also, the Indianapolis didn't deliver the entire atomic bomb to Tinian which was dropped on Hiroshima but rather the critical components for it, namely the uranium used. Quint's telling of the story makes it seem as though most of the sailors were eaten by sharks. In actuality, it is believed a few hundred men died in the initial attack. After the ship sank, most of the other deaths were caused by dehydration from spending five days floating in salt-water (and in many instances, from sailors being poisoned by drinking salt-water out of thirst and desperation). There were indeed numerous instances of sailors being killed by sharks, but it was nowhere near the number that Quint indicates in his story (specifically, when he says that over 1,100 men went into the water, 316 came out, and the sharks took the rest). However, a very large number of corpses were eventually eaten by sharks, and the Indianapolis incident, while often misleadingly dubbed as \"the biggest shark attack in history\" (based on the number of living sailors actually being killed by sharks) is still widely regarded as the biggest and most significant case of sharks eating human flesh."], ["Why would Quint say, \"I'll find him for $3,000\"? Wouldn't finding the shark be easy for anyone?", "It seems that it should be easy to find such a large predatory animal, but remember that the ocean is a very huge body of water and that the shark would have the entirety of it in which to hide. Quint knows that such a shark would be very difficult to hunt and find in the ocean. What Quint was really saying is that his price is $10,000. If they were to only pay him $3,000, they'd only be buying part of his service; finding the shark. The extra $7,000 would buy the catching and killing of the shark. It's more or less a negotiating tactic that worked out well for Quint because they eventually hire him. In the novel, when Benchley describes Alex Kintner being attacked, he goes into some pretty sharp detail about the shark's territory beyond the beach. There's a sharp drop off of several hundred feet about 50 yards from the edge of the beach. This seems to be the main area where the shark lives until it attacks. That's a huge area within which for the shark to hide."], ["How does the movie end?", "In the hope that he can inject a powerful poison into the shark, Hooper lowers himself in a shark-proof cage and waits underwater.

Quint slips on the wet deck, slides into the shark's great jaws, and is pulled under the water to his death. Brody, still aboard the sinking boat, throws an air tank into the shark's mouth and then manages to get onto the mast. He grabs Quint's rifle and, as the shark approaches, begins to take shots at the air tank. Just before the shark reaches him, Brody hits it and the shark is blown to pieces. The boat sinks beneath the surface and Brody happily laughs to himself. Hooper suddenly comes up from behind him. Smiling all the way, they begin together to kick their way back to the shore.

It would go flying off like a rocket if hit dead center at the end. If hit off center or in the side, it would spin in circles as it flew away, either of which would still have been fatal for the shark but in a much less spectacular manner. Spielberg decided that the ending would be more uplifting if he went against the logic and made the tank explosive (the film ending is very different from the original novel, where Brody's fight against the shark is of a completely different nature)."], ["Is it plausible that the shark would be able to jump onto the boat in the final scene?", "Great White Sharks have been confirmed to be able to jump up to 8ft in the air to pursue their prey so it is not unreasonable to expect them to be able to breach Quint's boat."], ["What are the major differences between the movie and the original novel?", "There are a number of differences between the movie and original novel (from which the feature film was adapted and based upon). Though the general idea is the same, both versions of the tale are completely separate in their portrayal of certain events.\n\n- In the movie, Brody and Hooper become fast friends and work together side-by-side. In the novel, Hooper is a cocky young rich guy from Amity who has an affair with Ellen, Brody's wife. The two become enemies and Brody's battle with growing old and his envy of Hooper is a major sub-plot.\n\n- In the novel the Brodys have three children: Martin Jr., Billy and Sean. In the film they have two sons, Michael and Sean.\n\n- In the novel, Hooper is killed by the shark when he goes underneath the water in the cage. In the film, he survives.\n\n- Quint is not killed by the shark in the same way as he is in the film. In the novel, instead of being eaten by the shark as it rams into the Orca, his foot is caught in a rope attached to the shark, and he is pulled underwater and drowns.\n\n- Brody does not defeat the shark using a rifle and the air tank as he does in the film. In the book, the Orca sinks, and Brody is left helpless in the water. As the shark swims towards him, he can do nothing but accept his fate. But when it is mere inches away from him, the shark dies, from days and days of battle with the men, presumably mostly due to blood loss and exhaustion from the barrels stuck in it. It is a very anti-climactic, yet still poignant ending.\n\n- The novel develops the character of Ellen Brody to a greater degree. Whereas the film shows that both Martin and Ellen Brody were from New York and have recently moved to Amity, in the novel Ellen is a former \"summer person\" from a wealthy family who used to vacation on the island, and Martin is a native islander. Although basically content with her marriage, she still yearns for her former life and sees Hooper, whose older brother she used to date, as a reminder of that life which leads to a brief affair with Hooper. She also works as a volunteer at the local Amity hospital.\n\n- In the novel, Mayor Vaughn's insistence on keeping the beaches open becomes a major plot point. Vaughn owes money to the Mafia; it is explained that Vaughn's wife had an undisclosed illness and that a desperate Vaughn acquired the money for her treatment from a mob-connected loan shark. Despite attempting to pay back the debt, the Mafia refused repayment, instead telling Vaughn that they would inform him when it would come due. Essentially extorting Vaughn, the Mafia then infiltrated the Amity real estate market (Amity newspaper publisher Harry Meadows finds that Vaughn's \"silent partners\" in his real estate firm are mobsters); hence his extreme desire to keep the beaches open, as a depressed real estate market would most likely result in the Mafia calling in his marker and Vaughn having no way to pay it. The movie removes this sub-plot and instead concentrates on the mayor's attempts to keep the beaches open to benefit the local economy.\n\n- Harry Meadows, owner, editor and publisher of the Amity Gazette has a far more expanded role in the novel. Seen briefly in the film and portrayed mostly as a patsy to Mayor Vaughn and the Town Selectmen, in the novel he acts as Brody's confidante and in fact is the one who digs deep, at Brody's request, to find out why Vaughn is pushing to keep the beaches open. Meadows is able to find documents that show the \"silent partners\" in Vaughn's real estate firm are connected to the mob and that by keeping the beaches open Vaughn is essentially trying to keep himself alive: a depressed economy would destroy Amity's tourist-reliant real estate market and most likely force his partners to call in a debt that Vaughn owed them, a debt that he would have no possible way to pay. Meadows eventually convinces Brody that the chief should keep the beaches open, if not for Vaughn's sake, then because the chances that the shark would attack again are slim to none.\n\n- Quint hardly speaks at all in the book and he's described rather differently\u2014he's tall and thin with a completely bald head and wears a Marine Corps. cap. The antagonism between him and Hooper, which is used mostly to comic effect in the film, is much more serious in the novel: Hooper, being an ichthyologist & more conservationist about sea life, hates Quint's methods (Quint at one point uses a fetal dolphin to bait the shark). Quint uses any methods to hunt sea life that he chooses.\n\n- There is a higher body-count in the book than in the film as well.\n\n- The book is much darker in tone. Most of the main characters are much more unhappy or ill-tempered, bordering on unlikeable. Martin and Ellen Brody fight quite a lot and Ellen seems impossible to please. Brody is very surly and more confrontational in the book too\u2014at a dinner party thrown by Ellen, he drinks too much and is rude toward his guests. As previously stated, Brody and Hooper become enemies when Brody feels threatened by the younger Hooper. Brody become convinced that Hooper has slept with Ellen (he has), and becomes obsessed with finding out what Hooper was doing on the day in question. Brody confronts Hooper before going out to sea and Hooper indirectly implies he slept with Ellen, causing Brody to lose it and nearly chokes Hooper to death while Quint watches rather nonchalantly."], ["Any recommendations for other movies about shark attacks?", "_Jaws_ (qv) is considered to be the benchmark shark-attack movie but, following _Jaws_ (qv), there have been a number of similar movies.

In Episodes II and III, the Galactic Republic's armored troops are clone troopers, cloned from the DNA of Jango Fett (played by 'Temuera Morrison' (qv)). Boba Fett is also an unaltered clone of Jango, raised as his son. For the DVD release of The Empire Strikes Back, 'Temuera Morrison' (qv) dubbed over the voice of Boba Fett to help tie in the original trilogy to the prequel trilogy. In Episodes IV through VI, the Galactic Empire has armored troops known as Imperial stormtroopers. A possible reason that Morrison does not provide the voice is because the stormtroopers may not be of the same genetic stock as Jango and very well could be men who were recruited without having prior Imperial affiliation (meaning the Empire did not commission their conceptions, births and upbringings), or they could be clone troopers constructed from more than one genetic template, excluding Jango.\n\nIt is possible and perhaps likely that, as the years went on, the Emperor disbanded Clone squads and started recruiting and drafting men from traditional families, and while there are still some Clone units scattered throughout the galaxy, they are mostly obsolete. However, Lucas has since gone on record saying that the stormtroopers that board Leia's ship in Star Wars are actually the clone troopers that Anakin led in the assault on the Jedi Temple in Revenge of the Sith, so make of that what you will.

The game follows the story of the 501st legion of the Grand Army of the Republic, later becoming \"Vader's Fist,\" Darth Vader's personal unit of stormtroopers. It is revealed in the game that they were, in fact the same troops that assaulted the Jedi Temple.

Is there a more detailed explanation?", "It would seem that the Empire could not have arrived at Cloud City before the Millennium Falcon did if they did not know where Han was planning to go, but it is plausible if you look at a few facts:\n\n* The simplest explanation is that Boba Fett was hot on the Falcon's tail when Han camouflaged the Falcon's escape from the Imperial fleet with the garbage that was dumped out. It was easy for Boba to track the Falcon; he has made a career of expert tracking of his quarries, and the Falcon could not travel through hyperspace. When the heroes started to get close to the Bespin system, Boba just transmits their location to Vader and the fleet.\n\n* The Falcon was hampered by an impaired hyperdrive that was, for all purposes, virtually impossible for Han to repair in a short time. Therefore, when the heroes started getting close to Bespin with Fett tracking them, the fleet would have the definitive advantage of speed and could have jumped to hyperspace instantly.\n\n* The Empire has the advantage of a large fleet that can cover the galaxy at most or all points. An outpost or small detachment of the fleet could have taken what Fett was reporting and surmised where the Falcon was heading. Such a detachment would have at least one commanding officer that could speak for Vader and tell Lando that the fleet was on its way. We can assume that Han, Leia and the rest of the group were there for at least a few hours before Vader himself arrived\u2014and after he did, Lando would have been given the go-ahead for the banquet. Remember, there is a brief scene where C-3PO is lured into a small room and blasted to pieces. A voice asked him, \"Hey, who are you?\" and there was definitely an Imperial stormtrooper who had been hiding in the room, perhaps with a group of them. Confirmation of the incident occurs when Chewie reassembles C-3PO and he says, \"Stormtroopers? Here? Oh, I've been shot!\"\n\nThe most likely explanation is the Boba Fett was able to alert the Imperial Fleet once he an idea of where the Falcon was going. Remember, Han is checking the charts for a viable system and makes it clear that there is not much in the area except for Bespin. Fett would also know this. As it has been pointed out, the Falcon has no functioning hyper-drive, and Han states, \"it's a long way from here, but I think we can make it.\" This would easily give Fett enough time to alert the Imperial Fleet and for Vader to easily arrive at Bespin before Han and the others."], ["How does the movie end?", "When Luke learns that Darth Vader is actually Anakin Skywalker, his father, he screams in denial. Rather than join his father in the Dark Side of the Force, he tosses himself off the catwalk into Cloud City's central airshaft and ends up falling out of the floating city's exhaust shute. Fortunately, he is able to grab onto an antenna before tumbling into space but, with only one hand, he is unable to pull himself back into the shute. He calls to Obi-wan but gets no answer, so he uses the Force to telepathically contact Leia, who is currently on the Millenium Falcon with Chewbacca, 3-CPO, and Lando Calrissian (Billy Dee Williams). Leia senses Luke's distress and guides the Falcon back to Cloud City where they rescue Luke. R2D2 is able to reactivate the hyperspace drive, thus eluding Darth Vader's forces.

By 1980, Star Wars fans were told that 'George Lucas' (qv) originally intended to shoot a series of nine movies, three in the present timeline of Star Wars, three in its past, and three in its future. In many interviews done around the time of the original film's release, Lucas said simply that he planned on making a series of Star Wars films, even if the first film was not successful. He did not name the number, but he would fund the sequels himself and, if necessary, he would shoot them as much smaller, cheaper films. By 1978, however, Time magazine confirmed that sequels were being planned and reported as many as twelve films total, and The Empire Strikes Back producer 'Gary Kurtz' (qv) was quoted as saying there were as many as five planned Star Wars sequels. By 1979, Lucas confirmed in interviews on the set of Empire that a total of nine films (a trilogy of a trilogies) were planned: \"The first Star Wars movie was one of six original stories I had written in the form of two trilogies. After the success of Star Wars, I added another trilogy. So now there are nine stories. The original two trilogies were conceived of as six films of which the first film was number four.\" Also around this time, actor 'Mark Hamill' (qv) was quoted as saying that Lucas had told him he wanted to shoot the later sequels when Luke Skywalker was Obi-Wan Kenobi's age. Many other people involved in the making of Empire also stated that Lucas had planned a nine-part saga, with the original Star Wars trilogy being the middle trilogy (this is also stated in the liner notes for The Empire Strikes Back soundtrack album). So by 1979, fans knew that Lucas planned to shoot a trilogy of Star Wars films and that he had another six planned after that. Lucas continued to talk about Episodes VII through IX, in interviews throughout the 1980s and '90s."], ["Did 'George Lucas' (qv) direct any of this movie?", "Although Lucas opted not to direct again after the completion of Star Wars, he did direct the short scene where medical droid 2-1B talks to Luke Skywalker while he is getting into his flight suit. Lucas also directed the new Wampa shots, featuring creatures like the legendary Abominable Snowman added in the 1997 Special Edition, and the revised elements of the scene of Vader's conversation with the hologram of the Emperor in the 2004 edition of the film."], ["Where can I read the script online?", "You can view the Star Wars V: The Empire Strikes Back Enhanced Script Presention, with highlighted dialogue, and over 800 screenshots appropriately placed."], ["What is the difference in dialogue between the original scene with the Emperor and the version found on the DVD and Blu-ray releases?", "In the new version, the Emperor tells Vader that the one who destroyed the Death Star was, in fact, \"the offspring of Anakin Skywalker,\" to which Vader acts confused, because Vader was under the impression that Anakin's child had died with his mother. This has led to some confusion, because earlier in the movie, Vader specifically searches for Luke Skywalker and already should have known that he was Anakin's son, though it is not impossible to think that perhaps some people around the galaxy would have the same last name and not be related. There were actually characters named \"Bail Antilles\" (merely mentioned in The Phantom Menace) and \"Captain Antilles\" (from Star Wars and the previous owner of R2-D2 and C-3PO). Also, the character \"Wedge Antilles\" is one of Luke's Rebel friends and a fighter pilot who appears in all three films of the original trilogy. None of these characters are ever suggested to have been related. The original scene can be viewed here.\n\nHowever, another possible reason why Vader is surprised to hear that Anakin Skywalker has a son is that he merely acts surprised to foil the Emperor. Following the destruction of the Death Star, Vader found out the identity of the rebel who was responsible. The name coupled with the boy's strong connection to the Force was probably enough to identify Luke as his son (Vader later tells Luke to \"search his feelings\" for confirmation that Vader is his father as well). As Vader reveals later on, he plots to overthrow the Emperor, and he believes he needs Luke's help to do this. To keep this plot secret, he also kept his knowledge of Luke's existence from the Emperor; suddenly admitting to the Emperor that he already knew that he had a son would be most suspicious in the eyes of the Emperor, so Vader may therefore act like this information is completely new to him. This is a scheme often employed by Sith Lords, as in Attack of the Clones, Count Dooku also acted surprised in front of the Separatists at the news that the Jedi had a Clone army, yet later it became perfectly clear that it was he himself who had ordered the creation of the army; \"lies, deceit and creating distrust\" are the ways of the Sith, as Yoda pointed out.\n\nAccording to the canon Marvel Star Wars and Darth Vader comic series, Vader did indeed know that Luke was his son prior to the events of The Empire Strikes Back. This is further supported by the fact that the opening crawl text says he is searching for \"Young Skywalker.\""], ["What are the differences between the original theatrical version and the Special Edition?", "In 1997, Lucas re-released the original Star Wars trilogy with some updated digital effects and new or expanded scenes. Of the three films, The Empire Strikes Back had the fewest changes made to it, though the most prominent changes include the expanded scene with the Wampa (the creature that attacked Luke at the beginning of the film) and the expanded shots of Cloud City in order to make the city look bigger and more crowded. A brief scene of Darth Vader returning to his Star Destroyer towards the end of the film was also included.

The DVD edition is actually the 1997 Special Edition, which was released in theaters and on video in 1997 and has been the cause of much debate among fans ever since. The 2004 DVD release has further minor changes and enhancements (mostly cosmetic such as color correction), the most notable of which is the scene, in which Vader talks with the hologram of the Emperor, which contains some new dialogue. A scream which had been added to the 1997 version as Luke falls down the Cloud City reactor shaft was removed again for the DVD and subsequent Blu-ray releases. After massive protests by die-hard Star Wars fans, Lucasfilm decided to also release the original films in their original theatrical presentations (i.e. without the 1990s digital effects), in 2006. However, besides smaller changes, the second release is not anamorphically enhanced for widescreen televisions but is presented in 4:3 letterboxed format. In order to use the full frame of a 16:9 television set, the picture thus has to be zoomed in, which lowers the image quality significantly. A detailed comparison between both versions with pictures can be found here and here."], ["What are the differences between the DVD and Blu-ray releases?", "For the recently released Blu-ray discs, Lucas altered some shots and dialogues of the Star Wars movies again. Only little changes were made for The Empire Strikes Back, like corrected colors in the scene where Chewbacca is searching C-3PO, and other small things. In general, one will hardly notice the alterations in the fifth Star Wars movie. Nonetheless a detailed comparison between both versions with pictures can be seen here and here."], ["What is the definitive version of the film?", "'George Lucas' (qv) has stated that the more recent versions of the original trilogy are the \"definitive\" versions. The reason for this is because, at the time the original films were made, the technology to bring Lucas' true vision to the screen simply did not exist and the cost to realize it would have been astronomical. With the technology finally available in the late '90s through the 2000s, Lucas was able to touch-up, re-envision or create from scratch scenes from his original trilogy. On the flip-side, many die-hard Star Wars fans disagree with many of the changes or additions that Lucas made to his original trilogy (most infamous is Greedo shooting first in Episode IV) and consider the original theatrical releases of the films the definitive \"perfect\" versions of the movies. As the technology is still a product of its time, the films themselves are still timeless. Also, the effects are still considered fairly good even when compared to newer films. The bottom line: it depends on what side of the fence you land on. It is your own personal opinion what version you consider \"definitive,\" but according to the creator himself, you will find the newer \"special editions\" are the definitives."], ["Will this movie ever get a 3D theatrical release?", "Originally the plan was the release each Star Wars movie, post-converted to 3D every February, starting with The Phantom Menace in 2012.

However, once Walt Disney Studios acquired Lucasfilm, and the production of Episode VII was announced, Disney eventually declared that they were postponing the conversion to 3D and release of any more of the previous movies in order to focus on Episode VII.

The plight of the one little girl in red touches him in a way the sheer numbers make unreal, it is easy to get lost in numbers. He transforms the faceless mass around him into one real palpable human being. This one child is a symbol of all the 6,000,000 Jewish victims, exposed to ruthless slaughter. The little girl in the red coat footage gives a feeling of hope. You think that she may be able to get away, that she has a chance. The girl in red is also alluded to in the book, and was called \"Genia.\" She was brought to the ghetto by a Polish couple, who had been looking after her for her parents, who were hiding out in the countryside -- but had planned to head for the ghetto themselves. She was delivered to the Dresners, as her mother was the first cousin of Mrs Dresner. She's said to have been very fond of the colour red, and was known as \"Redcap.\" Another reason for the red coat may be Spielberg's way of addressing the book \"Night\" by Elie Wiesel. Wiesel's youngest sister, Tzipora, who was killed upon arrival at the concentration camp, was holding her red jacket, which was the last image Wiesel had of her. Spielberg may be paying tribute to this amazing novel. There's hope that the little girl in red somehow survived.

Spielberg himself has given this explanation as well, further motivating this artistic choice with the fact that almost all real documentation of the Holocaust he has seen has always been in black and white. To enhance the documentary feeling, the movie was primarily shot with handheld cameras, and contains no crane shots. Director of photography Janusz Kaminski has further added that black and white contributes to the agelessness of the movie, something the makers strove very hard for.

Spielberg got permission to film within the walls of the actual camp but decided against it out of respect for the victims that had died there, so he had his production designers create a camp that closely resembled the interior of the camp on the outer side of the archway so a train could be used to depict the Schindler Jewish women being brought there. The actual camp is hidden through clever photography and cinematography."], ["What was happening with G\u00f6th's pistols while he was trying to execute Rabbi Lewartow?", "For the dramatic effect, the pistols not firing were probably supposed to represent a miracle that saved Lewartow with some sort of mechanical failure of the Luger G\u00f6th 1st used & the CZ-27 he pulls out of his pocket. Speculation on those mechanical failures can be found here for the Luger and the CZ-27. It's also possible that both guns were loaded from the same box of ammunition (as they both use the same type of ammunition), which may have been defective.

Didn't he come to Krakow without any money?", "There's an old saying; \"You have to spend money to make money.\". Schindler was schmoozing with the local Nazi and SS officers to build a customer and contact base. He'd already made plans to open the Emailwarenfabrik factory & supply the German army with cookware but he needed to find the right people to sell his product to, i.e., all the officers that frequented the restaurant. You can see him working up the chain of officers that come into the place. Schindler (at least in the film) is presented as not only very charming but also very cultured -- he orders appetizers and entrees that appear to be crowd-pleasing and converses with the Maitre'd about the right wine for his guests. At the end of the scene we see him having a drink with Oberf\u00fchrer Julian Scherner, who is the highest ranking officer that enters the place -- his rank is that of a senior colonel. If Schindler is able to, at the very least, strike up a friendship with this man, then Scherner will be likely to throw business Schindler's way through the other officers under his command. Schindler's strategy pays off well; he picks up a lot of business and begins making a lot of money. Schindler wasn't completely broke when he arrived in Krakow. You can see, while he picks out his outfit for the evening, that he has lots of Polish zlotys stashed in various places. Schindler is also a very shrewd businessman, as we see throughout the course of the film. He'd be the type of person to know how to stretch his money during dinner to accommodate his guests, however he did lavish on them quite a lot to gain their trust and friendship. Also, the restaurant management might also have, later in the evening, recognized Oskar to be a trustworthy customer and may have let him run a tab for his dinner expenses.

Unfortunately, Hosenfeld was treated brutally by the Soviets who thought that his claims to have saved many Poles and Jews were merely lies. He died in a Soviet detention camp in 1952."], ["What happened to Szpilman's family?", "According to the movie as well as Szpilman's book, he last saw his family when they boarded the train to the Treblinka death camp.

In his book, Szpilman tells the story a bit differently from the movie. Szpilman had several people taking care of him during that time and actually moved from apartment to apartment. After Gestapo raided the apartment of his first caretaker Mr. Lewicki (in the movie he was merged with another person from the book, engineer Gebczynski), Lewicki and Gebczynski went into hiding and Lewicki's brother took over. Since Gestapo was on their trail with secret agents constantly watching the building where Szpilman lived they had to recruit someone new to look after Wladyslaw. This was a very dangerous duty because, in Nazi-occupied Poland, helping Jews was punished by death for up to three family generations. In this situation the underground organization assigned one of its activists and a radio engineer, Szalas to bring food and news to Wladyslaw. So, unlike Szpilman's friends, Szalas wasn't helping him out of his own choice but acted on orders. He turned out to be a greedy opportunist who took advantage of the situation and left Szpilman for dead. Fearing reprisal for his actions, he disappeared with the money he amassed on Wladyslaw's behalf and no one knows what happened to Szalas."], ["Is 'Adrien Brody' (qv) Jewish?", "Adrien's father, retired history teacher Elliot Brody, is of Polish-Jewish descent. Adrien's mother, photojournalist Sylvia Plachy, was born in Budapest, Hungary in 1943 to a Catholic father and Jewish mother. When the Plachy family fled Hungary in 1956, Sylvia lived for a short time in Vienna before immigrating to the United States in 1958, where she was raised Catholic. Adrien was brought up Catholic but identifies with both religions as per an undated interview in which interviewer Emily Blunt questions Adrien about being selected to play Jack Starks in _The Jacket (2005)_ (qv). She quotes director John Maybury as saying Brody \"got the part because you look like an Arab but you're a nice Jewish boy from the Bronx.\" Adrien's reply: \"But John is wrong. I don't feel like I look like an Arab, nor am I from the Bronx, and I am Jewish and Catholic.\""], ["Was 'Adrien Brody' (qv) really playing the piano?", "Yes and no. Brody wasn't green at playing the piano, as he had taken piano lessons as a child. He admits, however, that he had to study every day for several months to play the Chopin pieces that he was shown playing in the movie because director 'Roman Polanski' (qv) wanted the scenes to be realistic and did not want to rely on handovers or hand-doubles. Basically, when you see Brody playing piano, he is really playing the piece. When you see closeups of hands, it is the famous Polish pianist 'Janusz Olejniczak' (qv). So, Brody performed Nocturne in C# minor in the opening scenes when the radio station was bombed as well as in his return to the radio after the Holocaust. It is said that the real Szpilman did the same; that is, he opened his return to Polish radio with Chopin's Nocturne in C# minor, the same selection he was playing during the 1939 bombing. Watch Brody's face for a wince at that actual moment. Brody also did the first several bars when playing for the Nazi commander Wilm Hosenfeld ('Thomas Kretschmann' (qv)) as well as the opening bars of Grande Polanise Brilliante, Op 22 during the closing credits."], ["What happened to the boy who was trapped under the wall while Szpilman was trying to help him? What was the boy doing?", "In his book, Szpilman says that, when he was finally able to drag the boy out of the drain, he was already dead because he'd been beaten so badly that his spine was completely crushed. The boy was smuggling goods under the wall, like the other boy Szpilman saw moments earlier that ran away -- they were small enough to fit through the drains that had been built into the bases of the walls, so smuggling things like food and other supplies was easy for them. Unfortunately, the boy found by Szpilman was caught by a German man on the other side of the wall, likely a German soldier or SS officer, and was being beaten when he was found."], ["How closely does the movie follow the book?", "Very closely. Director 'Roman Polanski' (qv) appears to have kept the story intact, even though he added a few scenes based on his own memories. Many of the scenes and, sometimes, the exact conversations in the book appear in the movie. However, there are a few obvious discrepancies. For example, Dorota does not appear in the book. Also, Polanski seems to have taken some liberties with the sequence of events as they happened in the apartments where Szpilman ('Adrien Brody' (qv)) hid.

There are two things going on at once: (1) Percy's management of the entire execution and his orders being followed (\"Roll on two!\" the order to throw the switch), and (2) Paul's reaction to the revelation about the sponge, the consequences that will inevitably result, and the reaction of the witnesses gathered in the room.

In the short story The Little Sisters of Eluria, King describes \"Doctor Bugs\", which are parasitic organisms that first heal people so that they might feed on them slowly.

To quote him directly: I'm tired boss. [...] Mostly I'm tired of people being ugly to each other.

If Percy felt that he was being mistreated, he'd simply call his mother or the Governor himself and complain like a spoiled child. The other argument is that it's a different time period. In the 1930s it was much easier for an inhumane person like Percy to work at such a job. The laws hadn't been changed to, say, profile a person like Percy for his mental illness. In modern times a condition like Percy's would've been discovered either through psychoanalysis when he applied for the job or because he'd caused a tragedy to happen. In the time the film was set, it wouldn't matter if Percy had been abusive toward a prisoner like Del, people would think Del was getting his just desserts for his crimes. The sabotage of Del's execution is something that might not have gone unnoticed by the proper authorities, however, Paul, Brutal, Dean, Harry and Warden Moores are able to cover it up since their jobs are at stake as much as Percy's would be. Percy, however, might have come out clean because of his connections to the governor's office."], ["Why does Mr Jingles live as long as Paul Edgecomb?", "Because of the accidental \"gift\" John Coffey transferred to the mouse while holding the mouse during Del's execution. John says later that the mouse felt what he felt. When Paul takes John's hand and sees what John saw of the murders, John gives him the same gift, although this time purposefully. However, there is no indication that Mr Jingles will live \"as long as\" Paul Edgecomb, only that they both will have extended lifespans.

In Switzerland they had brotherly love\u2014they had 500 years of democracy and peace, and what did that produce? The cuckoo clock. This isn't very true at all. The Borgias' power in Rome began with the election of Rodrigo Borgia in 1492 and ended with the death of Lucrezia Borgia in 1519, and the Borgias were the patrons of Michelangelo. However, Leonardo was patronised by the Medici, arch-enemies of the Borgias, and the Renaissance took place all over Europe, not just in Borgia-controlled Rome. Meanwhile, the cuckoo clock was invented in Augsburg, Bavaria in 1629, not in Switzerland. Switzerland itself did enjoyed 500 years of brotherly love, democracy or peace: the Old Swiss Confederacy, a loose alliance of Alpine states, existed from c. 1300. And while it's true that not much came out of Switzerland in this time, this is mainly because it was very poor, with thin mountain soil, and a bad climate. It didn't become a rich country until the mid-19th century."]], "0095327": [["A Note Regarding Spoilers", "The following FAQ entries may contain spoilers.

Also, to give the series and each character's story a proper closure, the producers felt that they should not even try to cram all that information into a single film so the decision of a two-parter was made. Also, if they would have made it into one film to fit in the details needed it would be nearly six hours long"], ["How many horcruxes are left in this film?", "Voldemort split his soul into eight pieces, creating seven horcruxes (the eighth part being his own soul). In the previous movies, Harry, Ron and Dumbledore destroyed three horcruxes: Tom Riddle's Diary (in Chamber of Secrets), the Gaunt's ring (in Half-Blood Prince), and Salazar Slytherin's locket (in Deathly Hallows: Part I). That brings the total amount of the remaining horcruxes to four.

Instead, the film adds the notion that he can hear them in his mind when he is near them, and he gathers ideas about where they might be throughout the story from various sources. Arriving at these locations, he listens for the characteristic Horcrux sound. This is explained as being the result of himself being a Horcrux. In particular, he gets the idea about the Cup of Helga Hufflepuff being in Gringotts when Bellatrix Lestrange ('Helena Bonham Carter' (qv)) screams at Hermione after she thought they had entered her vault. For the Diadem, Harry has a vision of Voldemort talking with the Grey Lady (Ravenclaw House Ghost, Helena Ravenclaw ('Kelly Macdonald' (qv)), daughter of Rowena), who he later questions for its location.

However, little time is spent dwelling on how this grows in the actual film. Also, the film deviates from the book by suggesting a romance between Neville Longbottom ('Matthew Lewis' (qv)) and Luna Lovegood ('Evanna Lynch' (qv)). Rowling has previously described Luna's future lovelife, which does not involve Neville; so in other interviews the Luna-Neville romance is explained as a \"summer fling\" in order to remain canonical."], ["Who is the other guy with Draco and Goyle in the Room of Requirement?

In this film, we find out that the patronus belonged to Professor Severus Snape ('Alan Rickman' (qv)). In the book, Snape discovers Harry's location because Hermione has a portrait of Phineas Nigellus Black in her bag. The trio frequently had discussions with Phineas, who also had a portrait hanging in the Headmaster's Office in Hogwarts. After overhearing the trio mention their whereabouts, Phineas told Snape. Without Phineas in the films, there is no obvious way for Snape to have found Harry. It is suggested that Aberforth Dumbledore ('Ciar\u00e1n Hinds' (qv)) gave Snape the information. Right before Harry sees the silver doe in the forest, he is looking into the mirror shard that Aberforth used to watch over Harry. Presumably, Aberforth recognized Harry's location and notified Snape. This would be unlikely as it would cast either Aberforth as a turncoat or would imply that against all logic he knew Snape's secret. Another explanation could be that Snape heard about Ron's capture and subsequent escape from the Snatchers; perhaps he had secretly put a Tracking spell on Ron, enabled his escape, and when realizing that Ron was about to find Harry and Hermione through his Deluminator, sent his Patronus for both Ron and Harry to see. This explanation depends of course on Snape's ability to find out about Ron's capture and secretly putting an undetectable Trace on him. It is even conceivable that the Deluminator itself can be traced; Dumbledore's portrait could have told Snape how to do this. A third possibility is suggested by the book, where a Patronus charm can be used as a messenger; Arthur Weasley sends one to Ron while he hides in Grimmauld Place, without knowing that Ron would be there. It suggests that either Arthur sent his Patronus to all possible hiding locations or that a Patronus can be sent out to search a particular person. Snape might have done the same by intentionally directing his Patronus to Harry without knowing the location. This explanation depends on the possibility that a Patronus could be used as such. If this is the case, it is no ordinary display of magic, because it would enable any wizard to find another person, by simply sending out a Patronus. Perhaps Snape's highly developed talent for Legilimency was also helpful?"], ["Isn't the Elder Wand supposed to be immune from Priori Incantatem (the thing where Harry and Voldemort's wands connect to each other)?", "Priori Incantatem is not simply connecting beams of spells. It is rare magic that occurs when brother wands are forced to battle, while it does result in the charms fired connecting, it also results in a dome of light surrounding the two duelling wizards (in the books it also moves them away from the crowd of deatheaters). There is a point that the spells meet, and when this is pushed back into either wand, it will force echoes of that wand's previous spells to appear. This only happens once in the entire series of 8 movies: When Voldemort duels Harry in the graveyard in Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire. Remember that Harry's wand with the core of the Phoenix feather was identical to Voldemort's, as mentioned in the first book and movie, the wand chooses the wizard, and because it turns out that Harry had a fragment of Voldemort's soul, they ended up with 'twin wands'. (Voldemort used his wand to kill Cedric Diggory, Frank Bryce (the Muggle caretaker of the Riddle house), and James and Lily Potter and echoes of these people come out of Voldemort's wand and help Harry escape.) What has confused people, is that in Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix an artistic decision was made to have the Dumbledore/Voldemort duel appear more visually impressive and take advantage of the scene being shot in imax by having the lava-like connection of spells (such a connection does not occur in the books). This is not priori incantatem. But the effect has remained in the following movies. The key difference being that there is no dome of light, and no echoes being forced from wands due to the meeting point of spells being forced into one of the wands. The only instance of a spell being forced into a wand is in the instance of the start of Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: part one when Voldemort uses Lucius Malfoy's wand, and the wand is destroyed. This was not Priori Incantatem, either. Harry does not cast a spell, the wand acts of its own accord (Harry is prone in pain), and destroys Lucius's wand. In the final duel, it is not priori incantatem either, the Elder wand is refusing to kill its master, Harry, and the avada kedavra curse backfires on Voldemort. Shortly after the novel-release of \"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows\", J.K Rowling revealed that the core of the Elder Wand was a Thestral tail hair, and the Elder Wand was the only wand in the world that had that kind of core, and because of that the Elder Wand can't create Priori Incantatem with any other wand, because there is no 'twin wand'."], ["Where is the third Hallow, the Invisibility Cloak?", "Harry already has it, because it is the Invisibility Cloak originally given to him by Professor Dumbledore ('Richard Harris' (qv)) in the first film. The book explains that it was probably created by Ignotus Peverell, one of the three brothers mentioned in The Tales of Beedle the Bard as the original owners of the three Deadly Hallows. The Cloak was passed onto his descendants and ended up in the hands of Harry's father, and finally Harry, as the last of Ignotus' blood line. The Cloak has an absolute invisibility, which does not wear out over time (like common invisibility cloaks do) and is shielded from most magic. Parallel to this, the Resurrection Stone was passed onto the descendants of its original owner, Cadmus Peverell, of whom Voldemort is the last descendant. Harry very likely keeps his Cloak in Hermione's bag. He uses it to stay invisible with Griphook ('Warwick Davis' (qv)) when they enter Gringotts Bank, attempting to get into Bellatrix Lestrange's vault."], ["What languages are spoken in this film?", "This film is spoken mostly in English with some characters speaking Parseltongue in some scenes. During the scene where Voldemort finds out Gringott's was robbed, he speaks Parseltongue to his snake Nagini, with on screen subtitles. In the scene where Ron and Hermione go to the chamber of secrets to destroy Helga Hufflepuff's cup, Ron speaks \"open\" in Parseltongue to get in. Generally only Parselmouths (Voldemort, Harry Potter, Salazar Slytherin, and Marvolo, Morfin, and Merope Gaunt) can speak Parseltongue. Ron Weasley isn't a Parseltongue but he merely muttered the Parseltongue word for \"open\" which he remembered from Harry speaking it. Ginny Weasley also isn't a Parseltongue but was able to speak it to open the chamber of secrets various times while possessed by Voldemort. Also, Professor Dumbledore can understand (and very possibly, speak) Parseltontgue, such as Goblins' and Mermish languages."], ["If murder scars the soul, does this mean that Snape's soul was also ripped apart when he killed Dumbledore?", "No. Only an intended, malicious act of murder would cause the soul to be ripped apart. In the book, Harry sees another one of Snape's memories, where Snape voices this concern to Dumbledore. Dumbledore reassures Snape by saying that he himself wants to die on his own terms, and that is why Snape must do it as an act of mercy, which will keep Snape's soul intact. He remains reluctant and the actual killing causes him profound difficulty (Dumbledore has to effectively beg Snape to do it), showing that Snape had no intention whatsoever to kill Dumbledore, and therefore his soul will remain whole."], ["Why do Snape and Lily Potter have the same Patronus?", "The doe was originally Lily's Patronus. Snape's Patronus took on the same appearance as a reflection of his love for Lily."], ["Why is it that Harry's horcrux can only be destroyed by Voldemort? What would happen to the horcrux if Harry were killed by someone else?", "As it is explained more fully in the book, Harry and Voldemort share a unique bond besides the matching twin cores of their wands. This bond was created by the fact that Voldemort used Harry's blood as part of his re-birth ritual in \"Goblet of Fire.\" Harry's blood bears the protective spell of Lily's love that was cast when she sacrificed herself for Harry, which means that Voldemort (unknown to him since he does not understand the magic of love) also bears that protective spell. If someone else were to use the Killing Curse on Harry, yes, Voldemort's accidental Horcrux (Harry) would have been destroyed, but Harry would also die as the curse is intended. But as long as Voldemort shared blood with Harry, then Harry could not be truly killed by Voldemort's Killing Curse - therefore, Voldemort destroyed his own accidental Horcrux, helping to lead to his own ultimate demise. Voldemort destroying the Horcrux was the only chance of Harry being able to \"come back to life\" and lead the final part of the battle that results in the destruction of Nagini (the final Horcrux) and Voldemort's death."], ["If Snape is really a good guy, then why does he betray Harry at the beginning?", "Remember that Snape, at this point, is a triple agent: he is, in fact, still loyal to the Order of the Phoenix he supposedly betrayed, and therefore has to convince Voldemort and his fellow Death Eaters that he is on their side. It is quite clear that Death Eaters who outlive their usefulness (such as Lucius Malfoy) quickly fall out of Voldemort's favour. Snape has a role to fulfill until the end, so he needs to walk a delicate line, remaining an asset to the Death Eaters by providing them with valuable information, yet not enough for them to permanently defeat the Order. The books also reveal why Snape was the best person to infiltrate the Death Eaters: due to his uncanny talent for Occlumency; not even Voldemort would be able to read his mind and learn of his true loyalties.\n\nIn Snape's first scene, he tells Voldemort when Harry will be leaving the Dursley's home, correcting inaccurate information provided by Yaxley. Snape is also correct in pointing out that the Auror Office is not involved in rescuing Harry, so nobody in a position of authority at the Ministry would know of the plan or its details. These were known only to the small group actually involved in the rescue, so one of them must have been Snape's source. The book's chapter on Snape's memory deals with some of this more fully. The rescue plan is actually Snape's idea, and he passes it on to Mundungus Fletcher using the Imperius Curse. In particular, it is Snape's idea to have six others pose as Harry so that Voldemort will not immediately know which is the real one. In the first half of the film, Snape notably does not give that detail to Voldemort. Voldemort is only able to correctly identify the real Harry because (in the film) Hedwig tries to come to his rescue, sacrificing her life in the process. (In the book it is because Harry refuses to kill Stan Shunpike to defend himself, instead employing the Disarming Charm (Expelliarmus), which the Death Eaters recognize as his \"signature move\".) Snape also does not give away which safe house Harry will be traveling to, something he should be able to find out quite easily."], ["Where does Harry end up near the end, and what is that sickly creature he finds under the bench?", "The ethereal representation of King's Cross Station where Harry ends up after Voldemort \"kills\" him, is known in catholic tradition as Limbo; the state between life and death for people who have not yet crossed over to the afterlife. For Harry, it represents a crossroads between life and death, hence it takes shape as King's Cross Station, Harry's personal crossroads between the Muggle and wizarding world.\n\nThe reason Harry ends up there has to do with two things. Firstly, Voldemort cannot kill Harry himself due to the blood protection (the \"old magic\" mentioned by Voldemort in The Goblet of Fire), which is detailed in the books but not in the movies. As Harry's mother sacrificed herself for her son, the proximity of her blood gave infant Harry a magical protection and caused the Killing Curse to backfire on Voldemort. Since Harry's blood is similar to his mother's, and Harry's blood in turn was used to resurrect Voldemort, this means that Lily Potter's blood now effectively runs through Voldemort. So this provides Harry with magical protection from death as long as Voldemort is near. Also, as neither Harry nor Voldemort know yet, Harry is the legitimate master of the Elder Wand, so whatever Voldemort tries, this wand will not kill its master, Harry.\n\nSecondly, Harry still has the fragment of Voldemort's soul inside, making him effectively a Horcrux. Voldemort's Killing curse cannot kill Harry, it merely destroys this soul fragment. Whether the weakened curse sends Harry's consciousness into Limbo, pulling Voldemort's with it, or the destruction of the soul fragments drags Harry into Limbo is debatable. Regardless, the stunted, deformed creature that Harry finds there is what remains of Lord Voldemort's soul. As the books explain, killing another person is the ultimate act of evil, one that tears the soul apart. Only a feeling of deep remorse for the killing could mend the soul, but such powerful feelings could also kill the wizard. As Voldemort committed dozens of murders and showed no remorse whatsoever, his soul is maimed and scarred beyond repair, forcing him to exist in Limbo and later the afterlife in this decrepit state."], ["How does the movie end?", "After Neville kills Nagini with the Sword of Gryffindor, thus destroying Voldemort's last Horcrux, Harry and Voldemort begin shooting magic bolts at each other, Harry using his wand and Voldemort using the Elder Wand. Suddenly, the Elder Wand causes Voldemort's killing curse to backfire, and the wand flies out of Voldemort's hand and over to Harry. Voldemort's body begins to disintegrate and turns to dust. Later, as Harry, Ron, and Hermoine walk through the rubble that was once Hogwarts, Harry explains that the reason the Elder Wand didn't work for Voldemort was because it actually belonged to Draco Malfoy ('Tom Felton' (qv)), who was the one to disarm Dumbledore before Snape killed him. Then, when Harry disarmed Draco at Malfoy Manor, Harry became the true master of the wand. When Ron enthusiastically points out that they're now invincible, Harry snaps the wand in two and tosses it into the chasm. Nineteen years past. Harry and Ginny are back on the platform, escorting their son, Albus Severus ('Arthur Bowen' (qv)), to platform 9-3/4. where Draco and his wife are sending off their son, and Ron and Hermoine are saying goodbye to their daughter before sending them off to Hogwarts, too. Albus expresses concern that he may be sorted into Slytherin House, but Harry assures him that Severus Snape, once the head of Syltherin, was the bravest man he ever knew. Harry also assures him that, should he wish to be assigned to Gryffindor House, the sorting hat will take that into account. In the final scene, the train pulls out of the station, while Harry, Ginny, Ron, and Hermoine, smiling proudly, wave goodbye to their children."], ["What happens to Hagrid after the battle at Hogwarts?", "Hagrid ('Robbie Coltrane' (qv)) continues on as gameskeeper. He is mentioned in the epilogue. Harry tells his son that he will be travelling in the boats with Hagrid to the castle."], ["What happened to Minerva McGonagall after the final battle?", "McGonagall ('Maggie Smith' (qv)) survived the Battle of Hogwarts and she became Headmistress. The Battle of Hogwarts ended in 1998 and she continued her job until at least 2008 - 9 years before the trio's kids came to Hogwarts. There is a different unknown headmaster when the children arrive at Hogwarts."], ["What happened to Peter Pettigrew?", "The movie gives no clear resolution on his fate; in the previous movie, he was Stunned when Harry escaped Malfoy Manor, so technically he was still alive then. However, Peter 'Wormtail' Pettigrew ('Timothy Spall' (qv)) is nowhere to be seen in the Battle of Hogwarts, which is curious, given his unrelenting loyalty to Voldemort. Although this doesn't provide any conclusive evidence, it is possible that he may have been killed in Malfoy Manor during Voldemort's fit of rage. In the book, however, during Harry's escape, there is a struggle in which Harry reminds Peter that he once spared Pettigrew's life (in The Prisoner of Azkaban, when Sirius Black ('Gary Oldman' (qv)) and Remus Lupin ('David Thewlis' (qv)) were about to execute him) and that he owes him his life. After mentioning that, Peter loosens his grip on Harry. Immediately, Peter's artificial hand (the one he got from Voldemort in The Goblet of Fire) grabs his owner's throat and strangles himself to death. Presumably, Voldemort must have made it so the hand would kill Peter if he ever disobeys him even in the slightest."], ["How does this film differ from the novel?", "The movie opens with Voldemort stealing the Elder Wand, which occurs in the book right after Harry's talk with Ollivander. Once Harry determines that there is probably a Horcux in Bellatrix Lestrange's vault, the film immediately cuts to them executing their raid. In the book they spend about a month planning out every detail. Bill Weasley also warns them not to trust Griphook, as Goblins still consider themselves master of the Griffindor sword, even though they had sold it to the wizards. In the book, both Luna Lovegood and Dean Thomas were rescued from Malfoy Manor, and are apparated to safety along with Ollivander before the trio sets out. Also during this time, Remus Lupin (with whom Harry had had a major rift earlier in the book) arrives and announces the birth of his son Teddy (to whom he refers later in the book and film). He asks Harry to be Teddy's godfather, which Harry accepts.\n\nThe raid on Gringotts happens largely as it does in the book, although with less danger or threat than the book gives this sequence (e.g. the duplicating artifacts in the Vault are also extremely hot). This film, like the others (except Goblet of Fire) differs in its portrayal of Polyjuice Potion, in that the user's voice (Hermione in this case) remains unchanged.\n\nInstead of also relying on the memories Dumbledore had shown him to identify Horcruxes (in the book), Harry fully discovers through his connection with Voldemort's mind what they are and where they are hidden in the movie. In the book, Harry witnesses how Voldemort is checking up on all his previous Horcruxes, since he cannot sense their destruction, and finds most of them missing (in the movie, Voldemort instantly feels it when his soul fragments are destroyed, and it temporarily weakens him).\n\nWhen they meet Aberforth in the book, he confronts the Death Eaters pursuing them and tricks them into thinking they were pursuing a false alarm. The mirror fragment that Harry carries around is from one mirror that he received from Sirius in The Order of the Phoenix; its twin mirror is found in Aberforth's hide-out. In the movie, there is only one mirror. Aberforth goes into depth about his troublesome past with Albus: their sister Ariana was once assaulted by three Muggle boys, and from the trauma, she became unable to control her magic. Their father killed the Muggles in revenge and spent the rest of his life in Azkaban. Then their mother was accidentally killed during one of Ariana's fits of rage, forcing Albus to abandon his career and care for his sister as Aberforth attended Hogwarts. During one summer, Albus formed a friendship with Grindelwald, and together they dreamt of a world where wizards dominated over Muggles for the greater good, and they obsessed over the Deadly Hallows. One night, this led to a heated argument with Aberforth, culminating in a duel where a stray Killing Curse killed Ariana.\n\nWhile searching for the Ravenclaw diadem, Harry is discovered by Alecto Carrow, who, before getting stunned, immediately warns Voldemort through her Dark Mark. In the ensueing chaos, Amycus is incapacitated as well. While Harry follows Professor McGonagall under his Invisibility Cloak, she is confronted by Snape in a hallway, leading to a fierce duel, with Snape jumping out of a window, clinging to a bat-like creature (in the movie, Snape summons all students to the Great Hall, trying to coerce the students into betraying Harry. Harry himself confronts Snape, but McGonagall fights him off, after which Snape Disapparates). Harry first asks professor Flitwick about the diadem, who has no clue, then Nearly Headless Nick (who hasn't appeared in the films since the second), who sends him to Helena Ravenclaw. Helena admits to be the daughter of Rowena Ravenclaw (one of Hogwart's founders). She had once stolen her mother's diadem and hid it; the Bloody Baron (Slytherin's house ghost) was send to retrieve both Helena and the diadem, but when she refused, the Baron killed her and himself in remorse, becoming ghosts.\n\nRon and Hermione destroying the Hufflepuff Cup is shown in the movie but only recounted in the book; Hermione kisses Ron afterwards, after Ron suggests that he should help the House Elves. Malfoy enters the Room of Requirement with Crabbe and Goyle, and it is Crabbe who dies. The Fiendfire in the Room is enough to destroy the Horcrux (in the movie it requires another stab with the Basilisk fang).\n\nProfessor McGonnagall's giggle about always having wanted to use \"Piertotum Locomotor\" (awakening the statues, suits of armor, etc., to defend the school) is a movie invention not in the book.\n\nSnape is killed in the Shrieking Shack--in which he has some significant personal history--rather than the boathouse, which was an environment that appears exclusively in the film.\n\nSnape's memories are far more expansive in the book, and include excerpts from Snape's life at Hogwarts and friendship with Lily; however, the friendship ends abruptly, due to Snape's grudge against James Potter and his own affiliation with the Death Eaters. There are several memories proving Snape's allegiance to Dumbledore: spying on Professor Quirrel and Durmstrang Headmaster Karkaroff, plotting with Dumbledore's portrait in the Headmaster's office, secretly helping Harry obtaining the Griffindor sword, and his reluctance to promise to kill Dumbledore (which Harry semi-witnessed in the film and Hagrid in the book of The Half-Blood Prince). It also shows how Snape tried to prevent harm to George Weasley on the night that the Order of the Phoenix escorted Harry back to the Burrow, but inadvertantly cursed his ear off. However, the scene where a heart-broken Snape finds Lily and James killed by Voldemort was conceived especially for the film and is not in the book.\n\nThe scope of the Battle of Hogwarts has been expanded in the movie to include viewpoints besides Harry's. Fred Weasley's death is actually shown in the book, though that of Lupin and Tonks is not. In the book, the Death Eaters are joined by many other creatures, such as spiders and Giants.\n\nHarry's conversation with Dumbledore clears up some mysteries: Harry can come back from limbo due to the protection provided by his mother's blood: when Voldemort was resurrected with Harry's blood, that protection fortunately went over to Voldemort's blood as well; as long as Voldemort is alive and nearby, Harry is protected. Also, the reason that Harry's wand was able to fight off Voldemort on its own in the previous movie, is because Harry shares blood and a piece of soul with Voldemort; when their wands connected in The Goblet of Fire, Harry's wand learned to sense Voldemort's actions, and could act on its own.\n\nDumbledore goes into detail about his friendship with Grindelwald and their youthful quest for power. Both wanted the Elder Wand to rule over the Wizarding World; he himself wanted the Resurrection Stone to reunite his dead family, whereas Grindelwald only wanted it to raise an army of Inferi. However, Dumbledore clashed with Grindelwald over the issue of Muggles (whom Grindelwald wanted to enslave), and with Aberforth over his intention to find the Invisibility Cloak to hide their sister Ariana, whom he saw as a burden. This caused a heated argument that led to a fierce three-way duel, in which Ariana was hit by a stray Killing Curse. Unsure who fired the fatal curse, a remorseful Dumbledore did not dare to confront Grindelwald for years, out of fear that he might learn that he accidentally killed his own sister. Dumbledore also explains that upon finding out that the black Marvolo ring contained the Resurrection Stone, he immediately put it on, just to see his dead sister once more and ask for her forgiveness; however, he temporarily forgot that it was a Horcrux and carried a lethal curse.\n\nUpon returning from death, Voldemort uses the Cruciatus curse on Harry's body to reassure himself that Harry is dead; the curse has no effect on him (not because Harry is dead, but because the Elder Wand will not harm its master). While carrying Harry to Hogwarts, Hagrid scolds the onlooking Centaurs for not interfering.\n\nThe final confrontation is also different. In the book, upon arriving at Hogwarts, Voldemort punishes Neville for his refusal to join him by cursing him with a Full Body Bind, and putting the burning Sorting Hat on his head. At that point, hordes of wizard families climb over the walls, together with Centaurs, Thestrals, Buckbeak and Grawp, which starts another battle that moves into the castle. In the confusion, Harry escapes and hides under the Invisibility Cloak, while Neville is freed from the curse, takes the Griffindor Sword from the Sorting Hat and immediately decapitates Nagini with it (in the movie, Ron, Hermione and Neville have to chase the snake all the way through the castle during the duel).\n\nThe book version of the duel does not involve Harry and Voldemort separating from the others and Apparating around the castle, with Harry revealing who the master of the Elder Wand is. Instead, Harry searches for Voldemort under his Cloak, finding that the Death Eaters' curses have little effect on his friends (later explained as a result of his sacrifice; like his mother, Harry gave his life for his friends, and his blood now protects them from harm). He finds Voldemort fighting off many other wizards, and becoming enraged when Bellatrix is killed by Mrs. Weasley. But before he can harm her, Harry reveals himself. He gets to deliver a lengthy speech, in which he both taunts and offers an olive branch to Voldemort: a chance to repent for all his actions, and a warning that the Elder Wand is now under his control (because Draco became its master when he disarmed Dumbledore, and Harry in return became master when he took Draco's wand in Malfoy Manor). More importantly, he reveals that Snape had never been Voldemort's man from the moment he targetted Lily Potter, revealing to all Snape's duplicitous heroic role. Voldemort nevertheless fires the Killing Curse, which immediately rebounds on Harry's Disarming Curse and kills Voldemort, who falls down lifelessly. In the movie, the curses meet again in mid-air, and upon defeat, Voldemort's body completely obliterates.\n\nIn the book, the Malfoy family has remained in the castle and is sitting uneasily among the victims and the victorious wizards, whereas in the movie, they already left Hogwarts before the last battle. Harry uses the Elder Wand to mend his own wand, and has one last talk with Dumbledore, via his portrait in the Headmaster's office, in which Harry promises not to search for the Resurrection Stone, and to leave the wand in Dumbledore's tomb (rather than destroying it), hoping, as Dumbledore had, to destroy its power by dying without ever being disarmed while in possession of it. In the movie, Harry simply snaps the Elder Wand in two, and throws away the pieces."]], "0032138": [["A Note Regarding Spoilers", "The following FAQ entries may contain spoilers.

In sepia tone, a brownish layer is placed over a black-and-white photo or film scene in order to give it a certain quality. (See here.) The dramatic change to color as Dorothy goes through the doorway was accomplished by having a stand-in, dressed in a sepia-toned costume, open the sepia-toned door. As the camera comes closer to the doorway we lose sight of the stand-in; then Sorothy appears in a full-color costume. Before the film received its 50th anniversary restoration, the Kansas scenes were always shown on TV in regular black-and-white. This is because, when the film was re-released to U.S. movie theatres in 1949, ten years after it was made, the Kansas scenes were printed on the film that way, not in sepia. The sepia was not restored to the film until 1989. This means that moviegoers, not just TV audiences, had not seen the Kansas scenes in their original sepia tone for many years.

Three theories have been offered by viewers. (1) Basterd may be derived from the word Baster, a word derived from Dutch bastaard (bastard). The original Basters were mainly persons of mixed descent between the Cape Colony Dutch and indigenous African women who at one time would have been absorbed in the white community. In the movie, the Basterds are American/Jewish, and their plan was very similar...to be \"civilians absorbed\" in France, walking among the Nazis. (2) The misspelling may connote that Lt Aldo Raine ('Brad Pitt' (qv)), who grew up in a family of backwoods bootleggers and moonshiners, has had little in the way of schooling.

While Landa is a bit of a sociopath, he also seems to keep his word when he promises LaPadite he won't kill him if he turns over the Dreyfuses. Landa was a brilliant detective, while at the beginning of the film, he says he loves his unofficial title of \"The Jew Hunter\" because he has earned it. Yet late in the film, when Aldo refers to Landa by this name, Landa is disgusted by it, because at this point, he was no longer \"hunting Jews\" so to speak and could be honest with Raine (though given his opportunistic nature, it could also be the possibility he claims to dislike his title as to appear a better person in front of the Allied Forces). So, at the beginning, he already knew that Mr. LaPadite was hiding the Jews beneath his floorboards, but Landa promised him that if he were to make Landa's job easier and admit it, that the German army would never bother him or his family again. LaPadite, put in an impossible position, reluctantly confesses and Landa has the Dreyfus family hidden beneath the floorboards executed, with the exception of Shosanna. Landa would likely want LaPadite to spread the story of what happened, so he would let him and his family live. Also, if one gains a reputation for being true to their word, it's more likely someone in the future would give up information easier upon promise of their life. If Landa went around killing everyone who was helping Jews, he would gain a reputation as such, therefore eventually someone would know that they were dead either way and likely try and kill Landa in the process."], ["In what scene does it show Lt Raine's rifle with the words \"_Inglourious Basterds_ (qv)\" on it?", "It is in the chapter where the Basterds are in a ditch, interrogating their Nazi prisoners, and one refuses to give up the Nazi position in a nearby forest - basically asking for death at the hands of the 'Bear Jew'.

However, this would not account for the other members of Hitler's inner circle who were killed in the theater, such as Bormann, G\u00f6ring and Goebbels.

There is a rumor that Tarantino said in an interview that Raine was lynched by the KKK for defending African Americans in the South. It is also been suggested that someone slit or tried to slit his throat but didn't go as deeply as intended or that Aldo fought them off quickly enough, although the scar does not look like that caused by a knife, and the screenplay refers to it as a 'rope burn'."], ["Was Aldo Raine Jewish?", "Though not explicitly stated in the movie, it is strongly implied in the film that he is not. He mentions that he is part Apache and that he was born and raised in Maynardville, Tennessee. He tells his troops that he was a direct descendant of Jim Bridger the mountain man, suggesting he is the hillbilly type (there were not many Jewish hillbillies).

Werner Rachtman) said that \"Everyone in the German Army has heard of Hugo Stiglitz.\" that doesn't mean that he was so famous everyone would instantly recognize him. His picture was in the paper, yes. But the rumours and stories about Stiglitz would likely mainly travel by word-of-mouth throughout the ranks of the German Army. Even if a good portion of the army saw Hugo's picture in the newspaper, he doesn't have any real distinct features that make him stand out in a crowd. Also it was said that instead of being executed he was to be sent to Berlin to be made an example of. Once the Basterds rescued him, Hitler's propaganda probably wouldn't want this to be found out (Keep in mind that is just theorizing) so they kept it quiet so most German Soldiers probably assumed he was back in Berlin. So when they see a man that looks much like Sergeant Hugo Stiglitz, but is in a Lieutenant's uniform, they may just think \"hey he looks familiar\" or \"Hey he looks like Stiglitz\" All the soldiers in the Tavern were very drunk and paid little or no attention to him as he also sat with his back to them. Hellstrom on the other hand, would likely know who Stiglitz was, as he was a Gestapo officer. But once again, may have assumed this man just looked like Stiglitz or paid little or no attention to him as he was focusing his suspicions on Hicox and his \"bizarre accent\"."], ["Why is Aldo so concerned about meeting with Hammersmark in a basement tavern?", "Because a basement tavern like the one the scene takes place in might only have one entrance/exit AND no windows. Such a layout offers very little opportunity, if a gunfight breaks out, for anyone to escape the ensuing melee. A basement bar like this one will likely have no windows, or windows that are too small to see anything happening downstairs which would prevent Aldo and the rest of the Basterds the opportunity to spy on the meeting and maybe see an attack coming. In short, Aldo is bothered that he wouldn't be able to see the meeting's progress. The chances of him actually hearing the conversation between Hicox' small team and Hammersmark would have been increased if the tavern were above ground -- they'd be able to spy on the meeting from another room or outside. As things turn out, Aldo was perfectly justified in his assumption.\n\nAlso, the men are merely meeting Hammersmark in the basement bar -- that doesn't mean that they'd intended to stay there & continue their conversation. As commander of the mission, Raine might have instructed Hicox to get Hammersmark & the rest of their team out of there ASAP but in such a way as to appear less suspicious. Wicki even tried to tell her that they needed to leave the place but she insisted they stay because her leaving so soon after she'd arrived would look suspicious. Plus, there's the factor of plain bad luck: Hammersmark never expected that the young Sergeant who'd just become a father and his friends would be celebrating in that very bar."], ["Did Landa know Shosanna's true identity when speaking with her at the restaurant?", "It's possible. He never saw her face while she was running away from him, so there is no way he could have known that she was the girl, although we don't know how detailed were the files Landa had on the Dreyfus family. It is possible he had a very good description of her or even a photo. Being a very skilled detective and interrogator, he acts as polite and respectful as possible and never shows all his cards until he is certain about the outcome. The beginning of the film showed Landa having a friendly conversation with Monsieur LaPadite whom he suspected of hiding the Dreyfus family, but asked for certain details about them to see how Mr. LaPadite responded, pretending to not really be sure about the details of the Dreyfus family was hint enough for Landa to know he was lying and confirm that LaPadite was hiding the Dreyfuses. Keep in mind that Landa also knew who Aldo, Donny and Omar were simply by interrogating the swastika marked soldiers. So he could very easily have known or suspected that Madame Mimieux was in fact Shosanna Dreyfus, simply by height, hair colour, eye colour and descriptions he had gathered from interrogations of other Dairy Farmers in the area. Perhaps the reason he ordered the milk and the cream was that he suspected she was Jewish, but as she kept her calm and even tried the strudel, cream and all, he either dismissed his theory or chose to ignore it. It's also possible, going with the assumption that Landa did indeed know who she was, that Landa was just testing her nerves. The more he prolonged the stress of him sitting there with her, the more uncomfortable she'd likely become. Not to mention she probably didn't have much of an appetite with him sitting there. While she kept her calm, it was also obvious she was still nervous. Perhaps when he said he had something else to ask her...then he paused...gave her an intense stare was just to gauge her reaction. As a cat toys with a mouse. Either for his own amusement or to see if she would try running at which point he could apprehend her. The reason he may have chosen not to act on his suspicions was because he was planning on betraying Hitler at the theater, and could have used Shosanna as a scapegoat had it not gone to plan. Though that is just a theory."], ["What did Landa mean to ask Shosanna, but then couldn't remember?", "We have no way of knowing, as he never asked the question.

Things are very confusing given that the events of the main shootout all happen in under 35 seconds:\n\n1. Stiglitz starts things off by telling Hellstrom to say \"auf Wiedersehen\" to his Nazi balls, then shoots him in his groin.\n\n2. Hellstrom then shoots Hicox in turn and hits Bridget in the leg, who falls backward in her chair, while Hicox falls backward and returns fire at Hellstrom.\n\n3. Stiglitz then stands up and repeatedly stabs Hellstrom in the back of the head, pinning his head to the table.\n\n4. Wicki stands up and shoots Winnetou in the back at least twice.\n\n5. Beethoven shoots Stiglitz in the back.\n\n6. Mata Hari shoots Wicki in the stomach.\n\n7. Stiglitz turns and shoots Beethoven four times in the torso and then also shoots Edgar Wallace in the heart, killing them both.\n\n8. Wicki shoots Mata Hari in the heart.\n\n9. Eric shoots Stiglitz with a double-barreled shotgun, killing him. [Note: this is the only shot that isn't definitive as there is an extreme close-up of Eric while he takes aim, but when there is a wide shot of him, he appears to be aiming in Stiglitz' direction. It was theorized he was shooting at the Germans, but Wicki wouldn't have shot him if that was so].\n\n10. Wicki shoots Eric in the head.\n\n11. Wilhelm blindly guns down Wicki and Mathilda with his MP40 submachine gun. [The way the final shot is filmed, it's possible Wilhelm also shot Mata Hari in the back, or it could have just been editing of Wicki finishing him off.]\n\n12. After Wilhelm agrees to surrender to the Basterds, Bridget retrieves Hicox's pistol and fires four shots at Wilhelm, hitting him at least twice in the chest, killing him."], ["How did Hellstrom figure out that Hicox was a spy?", "Being a member of the Gestapo, Hellstrom was suspicious of Hicox after overhearing his \"bizarre accent\". While Hicox explained why he had an accent pretty smoothly (that he was from a different part of Germany since the country has various 'High German' and 'Low German' dialects), he may have convinced Hellstrom he was truly a German. So, Hellstrom joins them for a conversation and for a card game. Hellstrom likely picked up something on Hicox again for not really wanting to play the game, then asking Hellstrom to leave the table after one round. When Hellstrom acts offended, Hicox clams up. Hellstrom then starts laughing and says he was joking and says that he would like to buy them all one round of drinks and then he would leave them alone. When Eric the bartender asks how much whisky, Hicox says \"Drei Gl\u00e4ser\" (three glasses) and holds three fingers up. He holds his index, middle and ring finger up. Both Hellstrom and Von Hammersmark notice this immediately. Notice how Hellstrom's facial expression and cheerful demeanor quickly goes stiff and silent, and Von Hammersmark looks mortified. Hicox inadvertently gave himself away by ordering \"three glasses\" with those particular fingers. A German would order \"three\" with the index, middle finger and the thumb extended. The other way looks odd, and a German would indeed notice it as Von Hammersmark later comments."], ["Was it really necessary for Bridget Von Hammersmark to kill the soldier Wilhelm?", "While Aldo struck a deal with Wilhelm, (we are shown Aldo to be a man of his word) Bridget Von Hammersmark did not. Hicox had also warned Aldo earlier \"If we get into trouble, we can handle it. But if trouble does happen, we need you to make damn sure that no Germans or French for that matter escape from that basement. If Frau Von Hammersmark's cover is compromised; the mission is kaput.\" While not explicitly stated, it's likely Hicox meant kill anyone trying to escape so as not to risk them reporting Von Hammersmark as an Allied spy. He could have just meant capture them (which is likely what Aldo was going to do with Wilhelm). However holding an enemy prisoner when in an area heavily populated by the enemy is extremely risky. So it's likely Bridget knew she had the drop on Wilhelm and decided to take him out so she didn't have to worry about Aldo taking him alive, especially after Wilhelm insulted her and called her a \"traitor\". Bridget was probably also a tad upset that he just aided in killing her allies and even an innocent waitress."], ["Why didn't Donny and Omar try and escape from the burning theater?", "Sgt Donny Donowitz ('Eli Roth' (qv)) and Pfc Omar Ulmer ('Omar Doom' (qv)) wanted to make sure they were the ones who killed Hitler and his staff. When they quickly became aware that the theater was on fire, they may have also realized that all the exits were blocked so they decided to go out in a blaze of glory, taking as many Nazis with them before they all died. A second explanation is that they may have gotten so caught up in the moment and were so focused on the killing that they probably forgot about the time left on the bombs strapped to their legs as all three bombs exploded simultaneously."], ["Why did Shosanna speak English at the end of Nation's Pride? She didn't speak English.", "At the beginning of the film, Shosanna doesn't speak or understand English, but the rest of the film takes place three to four years later which is more than enough time for her to learn English, possibly to avoid another situation like the beginning of the film. Also, it has been mentioned in many books that Adolf Hitler may have known a little bit of English (probably not French), so Shosanna might have wanted Hitler to understand the words she spoke (as shown when Hitler stands up and angrily shouts out \"Enough! Stop (the film)!\" after her film announces all the Nazis in the theater are going to die). Lastly, Shosanna's use of English is a simple continuity choice, as it is meant as a direct response to Frederick Zoller's line \"Who wants to send a message to Germany?\", which is spoken in English. The technical answer is that the scene was originally supposed to be in French, but 'M\u00e9lanie Laurent' (qv) suggested to Quentin Tarantino that it be done in English. Most likely because it would be hard to read subtitles during all the chaos."], ["What happened to Marcel?", "Marcel isn't seen after lighting the fire in the theater, but it is assumed he escaped through the exit behind the screen as he had to go outside the theater to enter through this door behind the screen likely to meet up with Shosanna outside. He may also have died, as the bittersweet last kiss between Shosanna and himself could imply that they were on a suicide mission. This is unlikely, however, as both of them had access to the outside (Marcel only locked the theater doors to the auditorium, not the doors leading to the outside), and Shoshanna could have left the projector room and escaped through the front door."], ["Why did Colonel Landa kill Bridget Von Hammersmark?", "At first it would seem he did this because she betrayed her country, yet Landa was already planning to do the same thing, so it's likely he didn't want to share the credit and reward with someone. Had he let her live, she would receive credit for getting the Basterds into the premier and Landa would only have gotten credit for not stopping them. But if the person who got them into the premier was dead, then how they got in was a moot point and Landa would receive all the credit for helping the Basterds carry out their mission.

Landa and turn in his scalp in the end?", "The Basterds, although cruel and brutal, still had their honesty. Not only that, but they were given orders by a higher authority. Raine was heard saying that what Landa was going to do would make up for the atrocities he has committed. \"Death and nature illuminate, elevate; love ventures under, the rest all never\" implies something in which Raine highly believes: giving the Nazis/German soldiers what they deserve. Landa did follow through on his side of the deal. Thus, it is not surprising when Raine and company decide to follow orders and not break their word/honor by taking Landa's life. On the other hand, you could also say that Raine wanted to brand Landa a Nazi, a memento he would have to shamefully carry on his forehead for the rest of his life, a stark contrast to the war hero who caused Hitler's reign to end."], ["Why does Landa betray Hitler?", "By the end of the film, Landa could see that in the situation where Hitler was inevitably going to die, and hence the Nazis were not going to win the war, he made the decision to betray Hitler. He goes to Raine to seek out a way to make him look like a hero. Landa traded Raine's life to hopefully be a permanent part of the history books, as the man who killed Hitler and ended the war singlehandedly. Had Germany continued winning the war and the history books been written by the Third Reich, Landa would be famous as \"the Jew Hunter\" and held in high regard for the future generations of people brought up with the ideals of the Nazis. Simply put, Landa didn't care which side he was on, as long as it was the winning side."], ["Why did the \"branding\" of Col. Landa seem so agonizing?", "The first soldier to be branded wasn't shown, simply the scar that was left. Although Aldo usually went just deep enough to leave a visible scar, he felt that Landa deserved a little more than the usual, considering the atrocities he committed. He also wanted to make sure anyone who met Landa would see the \"brand\" and recognize him for what he was. Consequently, Aldo dug his knife so deeply into Landa's forehead that it was basically carved into the skull, which is why Landa was in such agony. Aldo also seemed to do it a bit slower in order to maximize Landa's agony. This is probably why Aldo believes it to be his \"masterpiece.\". Alternatively, it's also possible that Landa is just a sniveling coward. He is more than happy to dish out torment and death on others and is 'brave' enough to kill a defenseless woman with his bare hands, but when it comes to actually receiving a taste of pain himself, it's more than he could take."], ["Aren't the Basterds a bit hypocritical at saying that the Nazis are evil, cold-blooded killers when they themselves are doing the same thing to Germans?", "This may be part of Tarantino's message: that all people, regardless of labels and categories, are capable of intense cruelty. Indeed, the Basterds are fully aware of this and relatively proud of it. Aldo's opening speech to his unit was essentially saying that they plan to give the Nazis a taste of their own medicine: \"Nazi ain't got no humanity. They're the foot soldiers of a Jew-hatin', mass murderin' maniac and they need to be dee-stroyed. That's why any and every sumbitch we find wearin' a Nazi uniform, they're gonna die.... We will be cruel to the Germans, and through our cruelty they will know who we are. And they will find the evidence of our cruelty in the disemboweled, dismembered, and disfigured bodies of their brothers we leave behind us. And the German won't not be able to help themselves but to imagine the cruelty their brothers endured at our hands, and our boot heels, and the edge of our knives. And the German will be sickened by us, and the German will talk about us, and the German will fear us. And when the German closes their eyes at night and they're tortured by their subconscious for the evil they have done, it will be with thoughts of us they are tortured with. Sound good?\" Nazis had a very similar outlook on Jews, homosexuals, Gypsies, and anyone else deemed imperfect. So Aldo and the Basterds took the opportunity to strike a blow at the heart of the German ranks by treating them no different than the Reich treated Jews. Not distinguishing between a Nazi and a German soldier was part of a prejudice necessary to their mission to wreak havoc."], ["Is this film historically accurate?", "No, this film is entirely fictional. In reality, the generally accepted cause of Hitler's death on 30 April 1945 is suicide by gunshot and cyanide poisoning. Although Britain employed Jewish commandos in a group called X-Troop, those fighters committed none of the acts shown in this film. 'Christoph Waltz' (qv) has stated that the film is \"a piece of art. Not a history lesson.\""], ["Does Quentin Tarantino make a cameo?", "Yes. Tarantino keeps his tradition of giving himself a small role in his films. In fact, he appears twice. First, he appears as one of the scalped German bodies when the Basterds are introduced, and later appears as a soldier in \"Nation's Pride,\" (the one that says Colonel, I implore you, we must destroy that tower!\") the movie being shown at the theater at the end. Nation's Pride was directed by 'Eli Roth' (qv), who appears as Donnie.

Like he did with the two Kill Bill movies he created a longer German Version of _Inglourious Basterds_ (qv) as well. Here, two dialogue scenes were extended during the \"Who am I?\"-game dealing with Winnetou who is a very famous literary character in Germany. These scenes can be found in the bonus material of the International Version, though.

For example...\n\n-We see a victim's attackers from their point of view. There are many point of view shots in Tarantino's work, including Pulp Fiction and Jackie Brown.\n\n-Tarantino continues to display his foot fetish when Landa holds Bridget's bare foot.\n\n-During a long conversation, the camera will circle around the table. The same technique is used in Reservoir Dogs and Death Proof.\n\n-Julie Dreyfus portrays a German to French translator in this film. She plays a similar role in Kill Bill Vol. 1 as a French and English to Japanese translator.\n\n-A character says a line in verse (Landa tells Raine and Utvich \"You get all four, you win the war.\") An example of this in another Tarantino film is in Pulp Fiction, when Paul tells Vincent, \"My name's Paul, and this shit's between y'all.\"\n\n-Samuel L Jackson participates in his 4th Tarantino film as film's voice-over narrator. Harvey Keitel makes his 3rd as the voice of the commander that Raine and Landa talk to over radio.\n\n-In the bar scene, Michael Fassbender, Til Schweiger, and August Diehl are involved in a Mexican standoff, much like the endings of Reservoir Dogs and Pulp Fiction.\n\n-In the opening scene, Landa drinks his entire glass of milk in one gulp before massacring an entire group of people. This is similar to an early scene in Pulp Fiction where Jules drinks an entire cup of Sprite in one gulp before he commits a massacre.\n\n-The scene between Aldo and Wilhelm after the shootout is similar to one between The Bride and the assassin Karen Kim in Kill Bill Vol 2.\n\n-Just after F. Zoller has shot Shoshanna, there is a shot, straight on, of him holding the gun on her, hesitating, moving it up and down. In Reservoir Dogs, Mr. Orange performs the same action, in a similar shot.\n\n-The only black man in this film (a Frenchman) is named \"Marcel.\" Marcellus was the name of the African-American crime boss in Pulp Fiction.\n\n-Sgt. Donny Donowitz shares a last name with Lee Donowitz, who was a film producer character in the Tarantino-written film True Romance, and Tarantino has confirmed that the two are father and son. Also, in True Romance, the character Lee Donowitz produced a war film called Comin' Home in a Body Bag.\n\n-The Basterds always leave one behind to tell the tale, much like Mickey and Mallory in the Tarantino scripted Natural Born Killers and Beatrix Kiddo in Kill Bill: Vol. 1. The confessions by the swastika marked Nazi's are also much like Sophie Fatale's confession to Bill in Kill Bill.\n\n-The same excerpt from the song, Crane/_White Lightning_ (qv) by RZA is used in both _Inglourious Basterds_ (qv) and Kill Bill: Vol. 1\n\n-Shosanna's message to the Nazi's being in English after Marcel says, \"Remember, in English,\" is similar to O-Ren Ishii's message to the Tokyo Yakuza in Kill Bill: Vol. 1, which is delivered in English after she says in Japanese, \"So you all will know the seriousness of my warning, I shall say this in English.\""], ["Any recommendations for movies similar to \"_Inglourious Basterds_ (qv)\"?", "Probably the best person to recommend movies that inspired _Inglourious Basterds_ (qv) is director Quentin Tarantino himself.

Upon close inspection, the front page halftone image appears to show that the Marton Brothers were killed in far off Red Hill Montana, and it was back in 1872. If Mortimer finds Monco at the center of that binder, that means the last page of the archive would bring us to the present day. At four to six pages per issue, that's a lot of papers, and assuming that in a place like El Paso they didn't publish every day, that binder can represent years. Another clue is Mortimer's attire: he wearing a tie with a \"four in hand\" knot. That style was invented in England at Oxford around 1880. We know that on May 19, 1881: Southern Pacific tracks reach El Paso, Texas, and that \" The Rock Island continued its trek westward and soon added \"Pacific\" to the end of its name as a final destination goal.

Blondie is just the nickname Tuco gives him because, once again, he didn't reveal his name.

The camera then pans down the stairs and out the front door, showing the bloodied walls and carnage along the way.\n\nCut to a montage of newspaper articles that, ironically, hail the taxi driver as a hero for shooting a famed mafioso. In a voiceover, Mr Steamsma reads a letter he sent to Travis, thanking him for sending Iris home. Dear Mr. Bickle, I can't say how happy Mrs Steamsma and I were to hear that you are well and recuperating. We tried to visit you at the hospital when we were in New York to pick up Iris, but you were still in a coma. There is no way we can repay you for returning our Iris to us. We though we had lost her, and now our lives are full again. Needless to say, you are something of a hero around this household. I'm sure you want to know about Iris. She's back in school and working hard. The transition has been very hard for her, as you can well imagine, but we have taken steps to see she never has cause to run away again. In conclusion, Mrs Steamsma and I would like to again thank you from the bottom of our hearts. Unfortunately, we cannot afford to come to New York again to thank you in person, or we surely would, but if you should ever come to Pittsburgh, you would find yourself a most welcome guest in our home. Our deepest thanks, Burt and Ivy Steamsma. In the final scene, Travis is back to driving cab and jawing with the other cabbies at the cab stand when he gets a fare. It's Betsy. After a strained silence, they make small talk, Betsy revealing that Palantine got the nomination and that she read about Travis in the paper, and Travis replying that it was nothing. Betsy gets out of the cab and asks how much she owes him. Travis smiles and drives off wordlessly, not charging her anything."], ["Why does the colouring look weird at the end of the film?

Lust may be specifically seen as excessive thoughts or desires of a sexual nature, which can manifest as sexual addiction, fornication, adultery, bestiality, rape, perversion, and incest. Gluttony is over-indulgence and over-consumption of anything to the point of waste. Greed (avarice) is the seeking of material gain over spiritual gain. Sloth does not refer to laziness, but to indifference, of an unwillingness to act, an unwillingness to care. Wrath/rage is inordinate and uncontrolled feelings of hatred and anger. Envy is jealousy. Pride is seen as the most serious sin, from which all others arise; a love of self perverted to hatred and contempt for one's neighbour.

The \"Greed\" victim was Eli Gould ('Gene Borkan' (qv)), a wealthy lawyer. He was purposely bled to death. The \"Sloth\" victim was Victor ('Michael Reid MacKay' (qv)), a notorious paedophile. He was tied to his bed for an entire year, kept at the brink of survival only through the judicious usage of intravenous drugs and medications, the experience of which causes him untold physical anguish and renders him completely insane. He later dies in a local hospital. Incidentally, he once escaped conviction for raping a minor due to the successful efforts of his lawyer, Eli Gould. The \"Lust\" victim was a prostitute ('Cat Mueller' (qv)) who was raped and killed by a man forced at gunpoint to use a strap-on dildo with blade attachment. The \"Pride\" victim was a model ('Heidi Schanz' (qv)) whose nose was cut off, disfiguring her. She was provided with a telephone to call an ambulance, hence living life disfigured and scarred, and sleeping pills to commit suicide and escape the life of disfigurement. She ostensibly chooses the latter option. Envy and wrath are not revealed until the very end of the movie. The \"Envy\" victim is the story's criminal, John Doe ('Kevin Spacey' (qv)).

The doctor explains to the detectives that the man's inner abdominal wall was what had ruptured.

Eventually, John announces that they have reached the spot, and the car pulls over near some high-tension electrical wires. They walk back along the road for a few yards until Somerset notices a white van approaching them. While Mills holds John at gunpoint, Somerset meets the van. The driver claims that he was just delivering a package for Detective David Mills. Somerset opens the package and steps back in horror. Meanwhile, John is telling Mills how much he admires him and envies the life he has made for himself, so much that he went to Mills' home that morning and tried to play husband with Tracy. But Tracy wouldn't play along, so he took a souvenir -- Tracy's head. John further explains how Tracy begged for her life and the life of the child inside her then realizes that Mills didn't even know she was pregnant. Somerset tries to get Mills to hand over his gun, but Mills goes crazy and shoots John six times. In the final scene, Mills is seated in the back seat of a squad car. As the car drives away, Somerset says in a voiceover, \"Ernest Hemingway once wrote, 'The world is a fine place and worth fighting for.' I agree with the second part.\""], ["How did John Doe select his victims? Was it long-term planning, or did he choose them 'on the spot'?", "It may differ from victim to victim, but a significant amount of planning for at least two victims may be assumed. Victor, the third victim (Sloth), was tied to his bed for exactly a year; keeping a person alive and hidden for that amount of time implies an enormous amount of preparation as well as dedication. This suggests that John Doe already selected Victor and began planning his entire work well before he captured him. Doe probably also had his eye on Eli Gould, the second victim (Greed), because he was the one who kept Victor out of jail. These are the only two victims with a clear connection to each other, as the other 3 victims do not appear to be connected. It is possible that Victor and Eli Gould were among the first victims targeted, even though they were not the first two to be found. Indeed, in John's home, several newspaper clippings can be seen on a cupboard that describe Eli Gould defending Victor and getting him an acquittal, so this may have been how John Doe selected them.\n\nWhich brings us to the seventh victim. It is reasonable to assume that Mills was selected 'on the spot'. He was recently transfered to homicide, and John Doe could not have known beforehand that Mills would be one of the detectives working on the case. Doe meets up with Mills at the scene of the Sloth murder, and personally experiences Mills' violent temper which would make him the ideal candidate; later, Doe has the opportunity to kill Mills in the alley, but doesn't, probably to preserve him for becoming the seventh victim. It is unknown if Doe had originally intended another person as the Wrath victim before he met Mills, and decided Mills would be the perfect candidate (he can be heard mentioning over the phone that he will be readjusting his schedule); but it makes sense that he intended the seventh victim to be an officer anyway: an officer of the law driven to the point of killing an unarmed suspect would attract a lot of (media) attention, and would ensure that his work would be discussed for years to come.\n\nIt is more difficult to determine when the other victims were selected. There is a picture of the fourth victim (Lust) in John's house, which may imply he had his eye on her some time, but without an indication of when it was taken, there is no sure way to tell. When John says that he has to readjust his schedule, it may just mean that he is changing the location of the murders, or his 'headquarters', not the victims per se. He had a special murder weapon created for the Lust victim, and the man he forced to use it on the victim seemed to be a completely random guy, but this does not exclude the possibility that the victim was carefully selected long before that. The same goes for the first (Gluttony) and fifth victim (Pride): they could have been selected shortly before, but given John's meticulous preparations, it is not unthinkable that he had them targeted for some time. Also, John mentions about the Pride victim that she was 'so ugly on the inside [that] she couldn't bear to go on living if she couldn't be beautiful on the outside', implying that he knew her personally, and she wasn't selected shortly before."]], "0088247": [["A Note Regarding Spoilers", "The following FAQ entries may contain spoilers.

Terminators (in their endoskeleton form) were originally designed by Skynet during the early days of the war with humanity for the purpose of carrying out the ground war against the remaining human forces. Being of roughly equal size to human targets and with similar mobility, terminators were able to follow humans where the larger HK (hunter-killer) tanks and hovercraft could not. Eventually, as the humans developed more and more elaborate methods of hiding to avoid detection by the aerial and ground HKs, the early versions of terminators (known in later films as the 600 series) were produced and covered with a flimsy rubber covering, meant to mimic human skin. After this proved to be very unsuccessful (the rubber skin would deteriorate and the terminators were easily identified), Skynet developed a way to grow human skin and fuse it to the endoskeleton of the terminator chassis (known as the 800 or 850 series). This allowed the terminators to more successfully infiltrate human resistance settlements and proved devastating to their efforts."], ["Who, or what, is Skynet?", "Skynet, despite being largely unseen, is the primary antagonist in _The Terminator_ (qv).

When Sarah telephones Ginger, the Terminator hears her voice for the first time and knows he has missed his target.

A scene was filmed in which Sarah traced the creation of Skynet back to a company called Cyberdyne; she suggests to Kyle that they go there and stop Skynet from being made. This would also eliminate the Terminator from existence. But Reese refuses, saying his mission is to protect her, not alter the future, which leads to a confrontation between the two that ultimately results in Reese suffering the emotional breakdown of being a man out of time. Another scene was set right after Sarah crushes the Terminator in the factory. Employees find a chip fragment that came from the Terminator's head, and suggest sending it to the company's Research and Development department. It is then revealed that the factory belonged to the Cyberdyne company. So the Terminator's mission to protect Skynet actually ensured its creation. This plot element, together with Sarah's intention to prevent Skynet from existing, was revisited in the sequel _Terminator 2: Judgment Day_ (qv)."], ["If the Terminator is an infiltration unit who can mimic voices, why does it speak with a thick Austrian accent while in America?", "The real-life answer is because that is how the actor 'Arnold Schwarzenegger' (qv) talks. _The Terminator_ (qv) universe answer is that Skynet obviously can't have every Terminator they create and send out on infiltration missions looking exactly alike. If they did, people would easily recognize them. Skynet's source for various likenesses are probably from either people they have captured and held in custody, or people they have encountered, killed, and/or fought out in the field. Tissue samples would be taken (for cloning, tissue cultivation, etc), visual images captured, and if possible, voice patterns and sound recorded. In a deleted scene from Terminator 3, Arnold's character is shown to be modeled on a military man, Sgt. William Candy who has a high voice and southern dialect. An official says \"I don't know about the voice,\" followed by another official, with Arnold's voice, who says: \"We can fix it.\" However, this idea is a later rationalization created by an author other than James Cameron and also not a consideration made at the time of the film's production. Also, as the scene was omitted from the final cut, it cannot be considered canon. Another problem with this explanation is that it has been established in _The Terminator_ (qv) and Terminator Salvation that early Terminators had very obvious rubber skin. While this skin was surely shaped like a human face/body, it was likely similar to a generic rubber mask one might buy in a costume shop, and not intended to look like anyone specific (i.e., Arnold)."], ["What is Kyle Reese's rank, badge number, unit, and commanding officer in the future?", "Sergeant Techcom, DN38416, 132nd under Commanding officer Perry."], ["Why did the Terminator flee the scene after the first chase with Kyle and Sarah? Wasn't that a perfect opportunity to kill Sarah?", "It does sound like a perfect opportunity: Kyle and Sarah are held at gunpoint by the police, so the Terminator should have merely drawn a gun and killed them all. However, when the police officers check Terminator's car, the windshield is still there, so the Terminator was not thrown out through the front. Instead, one cop notices that the passenger door is open, implying that the Terminator escaped through there into an alley. In one of the next scenes, we see Terminator entering a room to perform some repairs on itself. It opens up its arm, because the mechanics inside are apparently jammed, and removes the eye because it probably obstructs its view. Its gun was probably also thrown out of the car during the crash. _The Terminator_ (qv) continually analyzes its situation and mission parameters, and probably assessed after the crash that it could not properly handle Sarah, Kyle and an entire squad of police officers (many armed with shotguns which were capable of at least damaging it) with a defective arm, bad vision and no gun, so it chose to leave, make repairs first and then try again. When it attacks the police station it is fully functional, better armed, has the element of surprise and is facing the police mostly one on one and only armed with pistols. There are more scenes were the Terminator seems to make a careful assessment before chosing a course of action that has the best change of fulfilling its mission. When it has been run over by a truck later on, the Terminator could have simply walked towards the turned-over car with Sarah and Kyle inside, and killed her; however, knowing that its leg is damaged (it can merely limp) and Sarah may be able to outrun it, Terminator chooses to take no chances, confiscates a truck and tries to run them over.\n\nAnother plausible explanation is that the Terminator is programmed not to reveal what it truly is, since this information could not only hinder its mission, but also disrupt future events as well. In any situation in which the Terminator's true identity is at risk, it takes measures to avoid being discovered; hence the reason why it left the scene when it could have simply killed Sarah. In the end, by the time it has lost it's skin, it no longer matters, since its prime objective, at this point, is to kill Sarah at any cost. Also, there is no one else around during the final chase. You'll also note that without definitive proof, the police don't even believe Kyle's story. They tell Sarah that this so-called \"terminator\" is someone who is likely wearing some kind of body armor as well as being on drugs in order to offer, what they believe to be, a plausible explanation."], ["Why does the Terminator go to Sarah's mother's cabin before checking her house first?", "Several possibilities exist. 1) Sarah didn't record the address in her address book, as she knew it by heart. 2) The cabin's address was listed first in the book so he started his search there. 3) The cabin was closest to his present location when he began his search. As such, it takes less time to start there, than going back and forth to different locations. 4) _The Terminator_ (qv) did check her mother's home address before moving on to the cabin, we simply aren't shown this in the film. After all, there's no reason why the filmmakers would show us every dead-end along the way. 5) the cabin was her house."], ["Why did Skynet send back only one Terminator? Why not send back a whole army?", "According to Kyle Reese, \"Skynet's defense grid was smashed; we'd won.\" meaning that John Connor's forces had defeated Skynet & the supercomputer's defeat was inevitable. Sending a Terminator back was a last ditch effort on Skynet's part to try to erase the leader of the Human Resistance from history. It is unknown whether Skynet had the time, resources, or troops in general, to send back more than one Terminator. However, unused parts of the script from _Terminator 2: Judgment Day_ (qv) detailed a backstory in which the Resistance enters the Skynet facility, which contains the Time Displacement Device. They also find a cold storage full of inactive T-800 model 101 Terminators, of which only one has been sent, indicating that lack of infiltration units was not the issue. Most likely, the process of time travel takes a lot of time and energy, only allowing for one person or object to be sent at a time; if more could be sent at a time, the Resistance would most likely have sent more people back than just Kyle Reese. We can also assume that time-travel is pretty much Skynet's last resort, something they would only do on the brink of destruction. The reason for this may be that time-travel always carries a danger of making unwanted changes to the past, which may lead to unpredictable, but very negative consequences in the future. So Skynet probably did not start sending back Terminators until their very last moments; they had time to send just two (one T-800 and the T-1000) and got interrupted before they could send a third one. After sending Kyle back, Connor and his team destroyed the Time Displacement Device to insure that neither Skynet or anyone else could use it again.\n\nHowever, assuming they were able to send back a few Terminators or a whole army, they are likely to run into significant resistance from present day human armies pretty quickly, which number in the millions and are backed by intact governments with fully functional industrial bases. Not to mention, while Terminators are virtually impervious to bullets, they don't fare so well against explosives. So it wouldn't take long for a modern army to discover this. It therefore makes sense that Skynet sends Terminators back one at a time, but to different time periods: it would minimize the risk of detection, while at the same time doubling the chances that one of them will be successful. Remember that Skynet was able to virtually wipe out humans only through a surprise first strike nuclear attack which destroyed their societies. The human survivors were ultimately able to defeat Skynet using scrounged weapons and an improvised military force. Skynet's army of terminators would not have stood a chance against a pre-Judgement Day human military force."], ["Do Lt. Traxler and Detective Vukovich die?", "Lt. Traxler was shot in the gut by the Terminator. He is seen laying in the doorway holding his gut when Vukovich checks on him, he is still alive. Gut shots are famous for being very painful and causing a slower death. So chances are a surviving officer was able to call for medical attention so it's likely that he lived. After checking on Traxler, Vukovich stands in the doorway and opens fire on the Terminator, who turns and fires back. When the Terminator fires his AR-18, we hear Vukovich grunt, implying he was hit. It's unknown whether the shot killed him or not, the Terminator also fires one shot from his SPAS-12 at Vukovich but it's unknown whether it hit him. In a deleted scene when Reese and Sarah are running through the station trying to avoid the Terminator, Traxler stops them and finally believes them about the Terminator and hands them a gun to protect Sarah. After they thank him and run off, Traxler collapses against the wall. One idea for Terminator 2 was for Lance Henriksen to reprise his role as Detective Vukovich but now in a wheelchair, having suffered spinal injuries after being shot in the first film but this never came to fruition.\nIt has been argued that they both must have died otherwise the authorities would know about the Terminators but this is not necessarily the case. We know that Dr Silverman and many of the other police officers in the building survived (in Terminator 2 it is mentioned that 17 were killed and 13 wounded) but it would seem far more likely that the authorities would believe in a lone gunman wearing body armour rather than Sarah's wild story of time travel and killer cyborgs.\nUltimately the fate of both characters is left unclear, either or both may have died or lived."], ["Why does the Terminator remove his human eye?", "_The Terminator_ (qv)'s eye was badly damaged during the car chase with Reese and Sarah.

The same would also be true for injures that are sustained to a Terminator's exterior flesh that cannot be easily heal or heal at all.

Still, the Terminator succeeds in cornering them on some scaffolding, and Kyle is forced to place a bomb in the chassis of the android. The bomb explodes, scattering pieces of the adroid but severely wounding Sarah in the leg and killing Kyle. While attempting to crawl away, Sarah is attacked by the top half of the Terminator's skeleton. She succeeds in luring it into a compactor and, even while it still tries to break her neck, she crushes it until its red eye fades. In the following scene, she is taken in an ambulance to the hospital while Kyle is removed in a body bag. In the final scenes, some months later, a pregnant Sarah is driving through the southwestern desert and stops at a gas station. While her tank is being filled, she continues to dictate into a cassette she is making for her son. She questions whether she should tell him about Kyle being his father and wonders whether that will affect his decision to send Kyle back in time to save Sarah. A young boy snaps her picture and asks for $5.00. She gives him $4.00 and keeps the photo (it's the same photo that John will give Kyle in the future). The boy looks off into the distance and says that a storm is coming. Sarah replies, 'I know,' and drives off."], ["Where can I get more information on the movie?", "_The Terminator_ (qv) Enhanced Script Presention, with highlighted dialogue and over 300 screenshots placed in sync with the story."], ["Isn't the photo of Sarah a paradox?", "Not in the context of this movie. In the film we see that Kyle Reese fell in love with Sarah from looking at a picture of her which had survived Judgment Day. He describes how he was attracted to the melancholy look she had about her. In the final scene of the film we see the picture being taken and that the melancholy look is caused by the fact that Sarah is thinking of Reese, her dead love. Within the context of the first film, this should probably not be considered a paradox. What we see in _The Terminator_ (qv) is that history is unchanging. _The Terminator_ (qv) came back to stop John Connor from ever being born, but in doing so, it actually caused him to be born. In the first movie, time cannot be changed and there is no version of history where Sarah was not attacked by the Terminator in 1984. The second film doubles down on the circular nature of the timeline by making clear that Cyberdyne creates Skynet using technology which they reverse-engineered from parts of the Terminator which Sarah and Kyle fought. Thus, not only John Connor, but also Skynet itself are the result of the attempt by Skynet to eliminate John. The second movie, however differs from the first in arguing that time can be changed. The photograph, which is created by information from the future and then contributes to its own creation, is inspired by the time travel romance film \"Somewhere in Time\" starring Christopher Reeve and Jane Seymour. That film, which involves Reeve traveling back in time and meeting Seymour, has a pocket watch which exists in an eternal loop. It is never actually created but is instead passed from Reeve to Seymour and back again."]], "0021749": [["A Note Regarding Spoilers", "The following FAQ entries may contain spoilers.

However, George Miller refuses to call the film either a sequel or a reboot and simply calls the film a \"revisiting\". Miller claimed that after the first Mad Max film he doesn't really see a continuity or set time frame between the films, although he would think of 'Fury Road' as taking place after Thunderdome. In SXSW, George Miller also claimed that the previous three films exist in no real clear chronology, because they were always conceived as different films. Despite this, Miller did maintain consistency throughout the original three movies. In The Road Warrior for instance, the Feral Kid narrates Max's story from the first movie about how he lost his wife and child as a cop and then drifted off into the wasteland. Mel Gibson's Max still has the interceptor from the first movie, as well as a bandaged knee and leg brace from his gunshot wound at the end of the original. In Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome, Max no longer has the interceptor (after it was destroyed in Road Warrior) and fuel has completely vanished, leaving Max pulling his new vehicle with camels and Bartertown using pig manure as a substitute. One of Max's pupil's is also fully dialated from his eye injury in the second movie when his car flipped over. So even though Miller made the movies to work as standalone movies, he also made sure they connected and fit together too. Max having his interceptor back again, and being much more feral implies that Fury Road is more of a reboot than a direct sequel to the original trilogy.\n\nTom Hardy also spoke on this issue by saying, \"We have to take it differently as George is taking it. It's a relaunch and revisit to the world. An entire restructuring. That's not to say that it's not picking up or leaving off from the Mad Max you know already, but it's a nice re-take on the entire world using the same character, depositing him in the same world but bringing him up to date by 30 years.\" On the other hand, Charlize Theron also said that Hardy wasn't playing Mel Gibson's character. They just happen to be both named Max Rockatanski. In fact, Miller stated with the 30 year gap since the last film and a new actor playing the lead, it was just easier to do a new version of the film without maintaining any continuity. The easiest way Miller puts it is to think of each film as a \"legend of the Road Warrior\" meaning that each film is a story about Mad Max that happened, but perhaps told by different people and so some things are altered from each story.\n\nThe presence of Max's iconic 'last of the V8 Interceptors' police car suggests that this film follows directly on from the original Mad Max. It was destroyed in Mad Max 2 implying that both it and Mad Max; Beyond Thunderdome are in a separate storyline. However, in the original movie, Max had a son who was killed by the Toecutter's gang while in this film he's shown to have a lost a young girl (quite possibly not his daughter since she never calls him 'dad' or 'father' in the flashbacks). If you look closely or pause the movie, you can see that she was run down by Immortan Joe's war party."], ["What is Max Rockatansky's origin?", "The film doesn't clearly explain Max Rockatansky's origin other than brief flashes of his presumed daughter being killed. However, in the original Mad Max he was the top driver of the Main Force Patrol (aka 'The Bronze', a derogatory moniker used by the biker gangs Max tangles with), a national police force attempting to preserve order on Australia's highways as civilization begins to crumble. The film showed Max's family being run down on the road by a biker gang which led to him seeking revenge on those who murdered them, then heading out into the wastelands (the sequel suggested a nuclear war followed shortly afterwards, destroying an already crumbling society). A featurette on the character can be viewed here. Max also wears a near-identical outfit as he did at the end of Mad Max and the entirety of Mad Max 2: The Road Warrior. The right sleeve is cut off his jacket because a motorcycle ran over his arm and paramedics had to cut the sleeve off. He carries tools on him at all times for running repairs on his car. He drives the same modified police Interceptor. He also wears a leg brace due to being shot in the knee.\n\nThere is a fan theory that Max in this film is actually the Feral Kid from The Road Warrior and that he simply modeled his outfit and car from his idol, Max Rockatansky. The evidence in support of this is: When we first meet Max in this film, he has a very unkempt look (more so than Mel Gibson's Max ever did) with long shaggy hair and a beard. Throughout the film, Max says very little, often resorting to grunting or grumbling (which is all the Feral Kid did in Road Warrior until it was revealed at the end that he was the narrator, now an old man). Max's flashbacks in this film reveal he had a daughter who was run over by a gang but we don't see his wife at any point. The original Max had a wife and son who were run over by a motorcycle gang. We see several other people appear before Max in this film, people he failed to protect. These may have been surviving members of the group from the Road Warrior, of which the narrator mentions he became the leader. So it's possible the Feral Kid grew up, became the leader of the group and had a daughter, all of whom were killed, which led him to taking on the mantle of the Road Warrior, living in exile.\n\nThe counter-argument to this theory is that George Miller, the creator of the Mad Max universe, has said this character IS Max Rockatansky. The opening narration by the character says \"My name is Max. My world is fire and blood. Once, I was a cop. A road warrior searching for a righteous cause. As the world fell, each of us in our own ways were broken. It was hard to tell who was more crazy... me... or everyone else.\"\nThis implies he is Max and has Max's background of being a police officer before the nuclear war. However, he could be telling this story to whomever is listening in order to pass off Max's background as his own. At the end of the film, he also tells Furiosa that his name is Max, though he says it in such a way that suggests that he may be trying to convince himself of it as much as her, or perhaps that he hasn't used it for so long that it seems strange to him."], ["Aside from Max, who are the main characters?", "Imperator Furiosa (Charlize Theron): is a commander of the Citadel under the leadership of Immortan Joe.

It is called an illusion. 2) a body (or a person pretending to be a body) was planted there by the doctors who were trying to throw Teddy off the track of what was really happening on the island, 3) Teddy was having a delusion, perhaps fueled by drugs or the lack thereof), or 4) Teddy was himself mentally unstable."], ["How did Andrew's intake form come flying past Teddy when he was climbing down the cliff to rescue Chuck?", "Chuck dropped it. The book explains it in more detail. Chuck had acquired Andrew's intake form to show to Teddy. As Chuck was pulling it out of his pocket, it blew away and became wedged between a rock and a tendril of roots. Chuck then began climbing down the cliff to retrieve it. When Teddy thought he saw Chuck's body lying in the water below and tried to climb down to help, he found the intake form."], ["Did Teddy encounter the real Rachel Solando in the cave?", "This is a question that is open for the audience to decide. Some believe that the Rachel Solando in the cave was real; others believe that she was a figment of Teddy's imagination. It is possible that he fabricated the Rachel Solando in the cave, because what she says was everything he wanted to hear, which gives him a reason to find everyone suspicious on _Shutter Island_ (qv). Another suggestion that the Rachel in the cave wasn't real is how she refers to Teddy as \"Marshal\" throughout their conversation, even though she would have no clue that U.S. Marshals were coming to the island. Because she functions in the story as a way to advance Teddy to the lighthouse, she may be part of the role-play."], ["What is a lobotomy?", "Lobotomy is a surgical procedure in which the neural connections at the front of the brain are severed. It originally involved cutting holes through the cranium on both sides of the forehead and then inserting a knife into the holes and sliding it around to cut the connections, but later the connections were destroyed by electrically heated probes. The procedure was introduced in 1888 but didn't become commonly employed until the 1940s and 1950s. Lobotomy was primarily used in cases of mania, dementia, and insanity because it rendered the patient passive and controllable. Lobotomies are no longer practiced."], ["How does the movie end?", "Teddy climbs out to the lighthouse looking to help Chuck but finds nothing resembling an operating room. On the top floor, he is greeted by Dr Cawley who asks him about his hallucinations.Teddy accuses him of putting neuroleptics in his food and drink, having learned this from Dr Solando when he found her in the cave. Cawley says that Rachel Solando does not exist and that Teddy's delusions are much more severe than he thought, denies dosing him with neuroleptics, and further explains that the tremors are due to his withdrawal from chlorpromazine, a drug that they have been giving him as a patient at Ashecliffe for the past two years. He goes on to explain that Teddy is actually Andrew Laeddis, the 67th patient and one of the most dangerous patients they have because of his delusions and his violence towards the staff and the other patients coupled with his previous training as a U.S. marshall. In fact, Cawley has been warned that, if he cannot cure Andrew of his delusions, the Board of Overseers will have Andrew lobotomized. Chuck, safe and sound, suddenly enters the room and introduces himself as Dr Sheehan, Andrew's primary physician. Cawley and Sheehan explain that they constructed this elaborate role-play with hopes of awakening in Andrew the knowledge that it was his manic depressive wife Dolores ('Michelle Williams' (qv)) who set their apartment on fire and then drowned their three children in a fit of insanity. Andrew goes for his gun and finds that it's nothing more than a toy. In a flashback, he remembers the drowning and how he killed Dolores after she begged him to set her free. The knowledge causes him to fall to the floor unconscious. He awakens in a ward bed with Cawley, Sheehan, and the nurse who role-played Rachel Solando standing around him. Teddy lucidly remembers his life as Andrew Laeddis. Cawley and Sheehan hope that they have finally made a breakthrough. The next day, however, Andrew/Teddy confides to Chuck that they have to get off the island because whatever is going on there is bad. Sheehan indicates to Cawley that Andrew has again regressed into his delusions. Teddy muses about whether it would be worse to live as a monster or to die as a good man. Andrew slowly gets up and is led away by Dr Naehring, the warden ('Ted Levine' (qv)), and two orderlies holding surgical instruments. In the final scene, the lighthouse looms ominously."], ["What is the meaning of Andrew's last words?", "His last words are : \"Which would be worse: to live as a monster or to die as a good man?\", are open to interpretation. Some think he was indicating that he was possibly faking his sudden regress, knowing that this would result with him being lobotomized. This is perhaps because he does not want to risk repeating the cycle, does not want to live with his memories, or realizes that he is a monster and, as he agreed earlier with Dr Naehring ('Max von Sydow' (qv)), \"when you see a monster, you must stop it.\" Other interpretations include: (1) he is asking Sheehan whether it's better to live like him, implying that the doctors are monsters, or to die as a good man, or (2) he is wondering whether he could live as a man made monster, likening himself to the Golem or Frankenstein's monster created by the doctors, or whether he could die as a good man who 'blows the lid off' Ashecliff."], ["How closely does the movie follow the book?", "Those who have both read the book and seen the movie say that the movie closely follows the book, but it leaves out some revealing details. For example, the book gives more detail about Teddy's upbringing, explaining that his father was a fisherman who died on the ocean and that Teddy has always had a problem with seasickness, which provides insight into Teddy's illness on the ferry to _Shutter Island_ (qv). In the book, the code found in Rachel's room was longer and more complicated, and Teddy finds other encrypted clues as he explores the island, which he is able to decipher because of his training as a U.S. Marshal. At one point in the book, Teddy and Chuck suspect that Rachel fled with Dr Sheehan because they were in love. Teddy's dream of Rachel and her kids is longer and much more violent than in the movie, and Teddy was walking in the empty town of Hull instead of the Dachau prison camp. In the book, Cawley has a friendly conversation with Teddy in which Cawley talks about a girl in France he once loved but who died suddenly. Towards the end of the book, Teddy tries to escape from the island when he believes that Chuck is dead, but they were guarding the ferry, so he heads over to the lighthouse to rescue Chuck instead. Andrew doesn't come to sanity in the lighthouse. After the lighthouse discussion, Andrew was escorted to Ward C and was given a sleep injection. He wakes up completely sane in the middle of the night. Finally, the last line of the movie is not the last line of the book. The last lines of the book are: Teddy: \"I don't know, Chuck. You think they're onto us?\" Chuck: \"Nah. We're too smart for that.\" Teddy: \"Yeah. We are, aren't we?\""], ["Was Teddy being psychologically manipulated by the doctors?", "Viewers of _Shutter Island_ (qv) most often come away with two different interpretations of the story: (1) Teddy was being psychologically manipulated by the doctors so that he couldn't reveal the real face of _Shutter Island_ (qv), or (2) Teddy was himself a patient on the island and the doctors were trying to help him. There is evidence to support both points-of-view. For example, evidence to support Teddy being set up by the doctors includes (1) the doctors produced nothing to show that Teddy was a patient at the hospital except for an intake form that could easily have been faked, (2) it was never explained where Teddy was before he got on the ferry, and (3) Peter Breene, Mrs. Kearns, and the other Rachel Solando were obviously coached to lie. A fourth incident (present in the book but not the movie) was Teddy finding clues, such as piles of stones, that he thinks were placed there by Rachel Solando to warn him. Evidence to support that Teddy was a patient at Ashecliffe includes (1) Teddy found no evidence of any mind experiments when he searched the lighthouse, (2) Cawley and Sheehan seemed to know what Teddy was going to do and actually used words from Teddy's dreams, such as \"Why are you all wet, baby?\", (3) the names for Rachel Solando and Andrew Laeddis are anagrams for Dolores and Teddy, (4) the three children in Teddy's dreams were the same children in the pictures he was shown by Dr Cawley and (5) after Teddy's fight at ward C and before he lights a match, someone called him \"Laeddis\". A sixth incident (present in the book but not the movie) was a cryptogram discovered by Teddy that, when decoded, led to the message YOU ARE HIM."], ["What are the names of Andrew's children?", "At the end of the movie when Dr. Cawley shows the pictures of the children to \"Andrew\", he refers to them as Simon, Henry and Rachel. In the book they are Edward, Daniel, and Rachel. Edward was the oldest and Rachel was the youngest.

The drunkard asks them (in a weak attempt at a joke) if they are \"trainspottin.\" Welsh has explained that, when he was growing up in Edinburgh, there was an abandoned train station that had become a place frequented by the homeless and drug addicts. When the drug addicts were going to the station to take drugs, they would often say that they were going '_Trainspotting_ (qv)'. According to director Danny Boyle, \"Through the late '80s in Britain, it (trainspotting) began to mean anybody who was obsessive about something trivial, and part of that is drugs. It's a very male thing. Women, they know better.

It is contracted by eating contaminated meat and vegetables or by touching anything that has been contaminated with Toxoplasma. Cats are particularly notorious for carrying Toxoplasma (obtained from eating rodents and birds), which thrives in their feces. Symptoms of Toxoplasma infection in adults can range from no symptoms at all to general flu-like symptoms. Since the disease crosses the placental barrier, pregnant women are warned to be especially careful around cats and not to clean feces-laden litter boxes, as contacting the disease while in utero can be extremely harmful to a fetus, resulting in miscarriage, stillbirth, eye lesions, retinal damage, mental disabilities, and seizures. In Tommy's case, the disease formed a large abscess (pocket of infected tissue) in his brain that likely caused one or more seizures and interfered enough with his brain function to kill him. For more information about Toxoplasmosis, see here. It is especially dangerous to people who have suppressed immune systems like Tommy, who contracted HIV."], ["In what year is _Trainspotting_ (qv) set?", "The film doesn't intend to explicitly detail around what time it is set, and instead it hints its timeline through the music, as director Danny Boyle has stated in the making-of interview. Boyle also claims that it is set more precisely around the late 1980s. There are, throughout the feature, some suggestions that it may actually be set in the early 1990s, such as the techno music and a scene on which the characters talk about \"Russian\" sailors (which means that the Soviet Union may have already ended). Anyway, _Trainspotting_ (qv) can be set anywhere between 1987 and 1993 (the year the novel was released)."], ["How did Tommy become infected with HIV?", "The most likely explanation is that he'd become a heroin addict like his friends and may have shared an infected needle.

(Renton had also been off heroin for a short period of time, having been enrolled in a methadone program to wean him off heroin.

Subsequently, the paramedics would have called the police, and Swanney would have to either move his operation or he'd have been arrested and tried for dealing illegal substances and he'd lose his clients. The way Swanney sees it -- and his clients probably believe this as well -- it's better to call a taxi because the driver, who's being paid for his services, wouldn't call the police.

Renton brings up Connery's nomination and win of the Best Supporting Actor Oscar in 1988 (for The Untouchables), however, Sickboy dismisses it as a \"sympathy vote\", probably meaning that Connery had been nominated a few or many times in the past and hadn't won -- think along the lines of Al Pacino being nominated many times and finally winning in 1993 or Martin Scorsese or Steven Spielberg being nominated for the Best Director Oscar and not winning for many years, despite their performances or films being highly praised by critics and fans. Some of the other people Sickboy mentions, Charlie Nicholas (a Scots footballer), David Niven (an English actor), Malcolm McLaren (known best for being the Sex Pistols manager) and Elvis Presley, had, at least according to Sickboy's opinion, reached their creative peak and then lost their ability to entertain or turn out adequate new material."], ["Why does Spud mess up his interview?", "If Spud had got the job, then his government welfare cheque (referred to as a \"giro\" - short for Girocheque) would be stopped.

In short, the international community thought Rwanda was insignificant and hopeless so they didn't feel like it was worth their time. This decision was later regretted by much of the community. The deeper explanation is below.\n\nSince the decolonization of Africa after the Second World War, there has been an great number of wars between ethnic groups in Africa. This has origins at the Berlin Conference of 1884 where the superpowers of Europe essentially drew lines on a map of Africa and claimed bits and pieces of it for themselves. This created the modern day African countries, mixing ethnic groups and races that historically hated one another. This, as one can assume, caused many problems once the colonial powers were no longer there to enforce peace. Especially since the colonial powers had granted certain groups elite power, generally those who were seen as being more \"civilised\", i.e. most like White Europeans [ie the Tutsi] and these minority tended to rule quite cruelly over the majority.\n\nThis was the case with the Belgian Empire in Rwanda. The Tutsi, a light skinned group, was granted elite status over the Hutu and the lesser known Twa ethnic groups. It remained this way until a Hutu rebellion in the 1950s [After the Belgians had left] in which the Hutu rose up and slaughtered 10,000 Tutsi and took power. Many more Tutsi fled to Uganda to escape annihilation. Habyarimana came into power in the 1970s and he had a very friendly relationship with French president Francois Mitterrand. Mitterrand made very many of his diplomatic decisions in Africa based on what is colloquially referred to as \"Fashoda Syndrome\", a mindset that there is an Anglo-Saxon conspiracy to eradicate French culture from Africa (born of a conflict in Fashoda, Sudan in the 1890s). This friendly relationship, mainly driven by Habyarimana's francophone government that supported a quasi-democracy in Rwanda, continued well into the 1990s and even after Habyarimana's death. The relationship manifested itself into arms, military training, and even troops both before and after the RPF invasion that began the Rwandan civil war and well into the genocide. After all, it was the French that originally trained the Interahamwe. Now you see why France, one of the permanent seat holders on the UN security council, never voted to upgrade to a Chapter Seven Peacekeeping mission, one that would allow the peacekeepers to use weapons, on Romeo Dallaire's request.\n\nNow to move on to Belgium. The Belgian failure to respond is very easily understood. They were a part of the peacekeeping mission and even willing to help out until their 10 soldiers that were peacefully guarding the Prime Minister were tortured, maimed, and killed. Thus Belgium pulled out of the UN mission because the general Belgian public was unwilling to lose any more men. At that point they had no idea that the country was going to descend into an inferno of murder and death and they were more concerned with preserving public opinion.\n\nVery few people take the time to think about the mindset of the United States at the time. In order to fully analyze the motivation behind their indifference, one must look at the events that were occurring. The most famous being Somalia, where a mission that was to be pretty much a \"hole in one\" ended in casualties that should never have occurred. This naturally was a bit of a blow to the United States, who had invested countless amounts of troops and even more money to peacekeeping missions in Africa, some of which had gone very terribly wrong. Therefore when the Rwanda conflict occurred less than a year later, the United States was still stuck with \"We can't have another Somalia\" because they realized how detrimental that could be to the US Government. The way they saw it was that no matter what they did, it would not change the situation in Rwanda and it would only cost American lives without accomplishing anything. Yes, the US voted against sending 2,500 troops like Dallaire requested and, being a permanent seat holder on the Security Council, it made a big difference. But to blame all of this on the US is not justified.\n\nThe British turned a blind eye for nearly the same reason.\n\nThe fact of the matter is this, Rwanda has no natural resources and very little to offer to anyone but the French who needed another francophone country to battle the \"invasion of the Anglo-Saxons\". And even the French did not care. Francois Mitterrand once said that \"in a country like that a genocide does not matter\" which, for the most part, fully encompasses how the international world felt about Rwanda at the time."]], "0347149": [["A NOTE REGARDING SPOILERS", "The following FAQ entries may contain spoilers.

It is a possibility that the brief moments in the film in which Sophie is seen as a young woman are not real; rather, they are what Howl sees when he looks at her.\n\nIt is also revealed at the end of the novel that Sophie is a talented witch, and that Howl had lifted--or attempted to lift--her curse much earlier, but that she wouldn't let him; she was unconsciously keeping herself old. Sophie felt safe as an old lady, and free to speak her mind--she was essentially more herself as an elderly woman than as a young one. It is thus possible that, in the film, when Sophie occasionally returns to a young woman in Howl's presence, it is because she has unconsciously loosened her grip on the curse: she feels like herself around Howl, and she lets her guard down. Once she begins feeling uncomfortable or afraid again (such as in the meadow scene, when he tells her she's beautiful), she becomes old once more.\n\nAs for her hair color--at the end of the novel, Sophie's hair returns to its natural auburn color. The reason her hair remains gray or \"starlight\" colored in the film is never disclosed; however, it is possible that the filmmakers intended it to be a mark of the wisdom she's gained.

Sometimes they're stuck acting out elements of their lives, or deaths. Malcolm Crowe seems to be more fully developed than some of the ghosts, but he also doesn't know that he's dead. He's not living through his life 24 hours a day like a living person would. Instead he sort of fades in and out at different times. So he takes his wife's silence (and her possible romantic interest in another man) as a sign of their failing marriage, not that he's dead. We see a direct reference to Malcolm's selective awareness in the climactic scene where he finally realizes he's dead. Throughout the movie, Malcolm has had difficulty opening the door to his basement office. Malcolm, and the viewer, initially think that the handle is merely stuck. But in the climactic scene, Malcolm realizes the truth, that he can't open the door because his wife has blocked it off with a table. He just never saw that before. In the film, we see a couple of scenes of Malcolm working in his office, but we never actually see him open the door and enter his office. That's because he doesn't do it.

Young boys like Tommy ('Thomas Handley' (qv)) could even make money by catching stray birds and returning them to their owners, who might pay them a quarter or more for each bird returned. In the movie, the raising of pigeons served two purposes: (1) it provided a way of luring Joey Doyle up to his rooftop, and (2) it showed the audience that Terry had a soft side, a conscience. Some viewers also point out that the pigeons are symbolic of the dock workers. Early in the film, Terry describes to Edie how hawks perched atop big hotels will occasionally swoop in and snatch a pigeon, a metaphor for the pigeons (like the dock workers) being in constant peril from the hawks (bosses)."], ["When Terry and Edie go out to the bar for a beer, what is that that they drink first from the shotglasses?", "Whiskey.

He more than likely used a daub of glue or resin from the prison labor workshop to pin the top two corners. A tack can quite easily be pushed into plaster. We know the walls were plastered because Andy dislodges a chunk when scratching his name into the wall prompting him to dig the tunnel. In real life, inmates use toothpaste to hang posters in the cells today. In the novella, the walls were made of cement that was improperly mixed in order to save costs. The result was a soft cement that Andy was able to chisel through with a small rock hammer."], ["What song does Andy play on the speakers when he is in the Warden's office?", "\"Sull'aria Che soave zeffiretto\" from Mozart's Marriage of Figaro."], ["Why does Andy lock the guard in the bathroom while he plays the Mozart record?", "Very often in prisons, especially in earlier years, music and media are handled very carefully and often regarded as potentially harmful and rabble-rousing material. Dufresne knew he had to keep the guard from being able to immediately turn off the music. Another possibility is that Andy is exercising freedom and wants it to last as long as possible. He is refilling his emotional gas-tank with art and wanted to share that feeling with the entire prison population. The guard, no matter how friendly he appears to be toward Andy, would no doubt stop him immediately because it's his duty.

Since he can legally employ his men for below minimum wage he is able to offer very competitive bids on construction projects. Some companies offer him a personal payoff in order to secure the cheap labor for their projects. Other construction companies also offer him payoffs in order to NOT bid on certain projects so they can retain work."], ["Why would Andy leave money and a note for Red out in the open? Isn't this a bit risky?", "Some people think that Andy leaving the tin with the money, and postcard telling Red where to find Andy was a bit risky because leaving it there for years, it could either be stumbled upon, or the area could have been urbanized and it would have been destroyed -- the latter was a very real concern of Andy's in the novella. First, Andy obviously put it there after he escaped, not before he went to prison (how else would a note for Red be there?). After Andy escapes, some time passes and Red goes for his 40-year parole hearing, upon which he is released. Andy was in prison for 19 years. So only a year or so had passed before Red got paroled and probably only a couple weeks before he decided to find Andy, which isn't too risky overall. Andy is very careful with the postcard and the note. The postcard has no message or signature, just the Fort Hancock postmark. The letter with the money is to \"Red\" (not \"Ellis Boyd Redding\") from \"Andy\" (with no last name). It does not mention prison, escapes, the name of the Mexican town (or Mexico at all!) or that Red knows how to \"get things.\" It does discuss coming this far, a man of your abilities, \"my project,\" and how hope is a good thing. It's a much safer way of getting Red down to Mexico than sending money or a check (way too traceable) in the mail, IF Andy could have located Red once he was paroled. Since he was serving two life sentences for a double murder, Andy would be subject to extradition back to the States if he were caught. Andy could certainly afford to lose the money if someone else found it or it was destroyed; it was worth that small risk to help Red."], ["Why does Andy use one of the banks' postal service to send the package?", "The most likely explanation based on the storyline is that Andy, having escaped from Shawshank just the night before and not knowing the extent or progress of any efforts to find him and return him to prison, prioritized completing all local business as quickly as possible, especially the most public tasks (he could save for later things like planting the note and money for Red in the agreed upon location), in order to maximize his chances of making it out of New England and onward to Texas and then Mexico, where he could live essentially free of the risk and fear of being recaptured by authorities. At that point in the story, Andy was already in the middle of decisively playing his extremely risky hand, and he added no additional risk by leaving the package in the hands of the bankers, who would certainly remember him and his visit regardless of that choice, whereas even taking the time to go to a post office would have added precious minutes to his public appearances in the area and exposed him to more people.\n\nThe filmmakers' goal of efficient and thorough storytelling provides several more probable explanations, the most straightforward being that the choice allows viewers to see the mailing explicitly by adding only a few seconds to the bank scene. To accomplish that same storytelling goal, another means, such as a trip to the post office, would have likely required a whole extra scene that might have unnecessarily broken up the flow of the movie in a crucial phase of its story and certainly would have added run-time to the film, as well as an additional shooting location, perhaps more actors, time, cost, etc. to the film's production. Andy's decision to allow the bank to handle the mailing, perhaps unplanned and prompted only by the female bank employee's asking him politely whether they could \"do anything else\" for him, gave the filmmakers an opportunity not only to show the mailing itself but also to highlight, through the casual and gentle attitude he displays, Andy's confidence and aura of tranquility, remarkable (but not too surprising at this point of the film, coming from Andy) given the perilous nature and the extremely high stakes of his situation, not just for him personally but also for countless others and perhaps even for society as a whole. The brief exchange also emphasizes the dramatic shift of power almost two decades in the making that Andy had finally, dramatically brought about and was, at that moment, pointedly experiencing for himself[spoiler], having broken away from the cruel and domineering rule of Shawshank and Warden Norton and finding himself no longer society's prisoner and Norton's slave but instead the deeply respected and important customer of Norton's bank and, more importantly, the recipient of Norton's tainted fortune and the server of proper justice regarding the ironic criminal activities of his former prison. Another good point would be that any mail received from a bank or any mail being sent out from the bank would be given preferred and guaranteed treatment by all involved. A bank back then was a revered institution and the reporter upon examination of the source would be very intrigued and accepting of this source..."], ["How does the movie end?", "Red's parole request is finally granted but, after 40 years of incarceration at Shawshank, he has a hard time adjusting to life outside the prison. All he seems able to do is to think of ways to break his parole so that they will send him back to Shawshank. Instead, he decides to take Andy up on his offer. He hitchhikes to Buxton where he finds the stone wall just as Andy described it. Walking alongside the wall, he finds the 'out-of-place' rock and a cache of money that Andy left for him. He takes a Trailways bus to Fort Hancock, Texas and finds himself excited and hopeful albeit a bit worried about getting across the Mexican border and jumping his parole.

A few minor changes were made to tighten up the story but it mostly stays very faithful to the source. Some notable changes: (1) Andy serves a total of 27 years instead of 19; (2) Andy is not a tall, thin man like 'Tim Robbins' (qv), but is actually short and thin. However, he's still very intelligent and crafty like the Andy of the movie; (3) Red is not an middle-aged African American man, but a middle-aged Irishman with graying red hair (hence the nickname); (4) During Andy's incarceration, the prison is overseen by at least 3 different wardens, all with different personalities and motives. The last one in the novella is Norton (his 1st name is Samuel), who is the pious man played by actor Bob Gunton in the movie. The Norton in the film is a composite character of the other wardens, a way to tighten the story up; (5) In the book, Tommy is not murdered by Hadley on orders from the warden. Norton instead offers Tommy a chance to be transferred to a minimum security prison with more privileges (furloughs with his wife, increased visitation, etc) in another part of Maine if he keeps quiet about the evidence that could clear Andy's name. Tommy's story is also slightly different in the book -- he relates that Blatch told him the double murder was pinned on a lawyer rather than a banker, and Andy latches onto it with the thinking that the two professions were often confused for one another (in those days); (6) Brooks Hatlen's post-incarceration story is not in the original novella. More of post-prison life is told by Red himself after he's released. Having Brooks tell the story in the movie probably lent more drama to the script; (7) In the book, Red's search for the proper hayfield where Andy left his package is a fairly substantial piece of the plot. In the film, Red simply goes directly to the correct hayfield. Also, the book leaves it ambiguous whether Red in fact meets Andy in Mexico. The film originally did too. The scene of Red meeting Andy on the beach as he sands a boat was added after the first cut of the film was shown to focus groups, who wanted a happier ending.

Marty snuck into Docs lab, and was fascinated by all the cool stuff that was there. when Doc found him there, he was delighted to find that Marty thought he was cool and accepted him for what he was.

When he arrives back to 1985 he discovers that Doc is still alive and was wearing a bullet proof vest. This is because as we find out, Doc read the letter, but the Doc we saw before Marty went back to 1955 really did die.\nA similar thing is how Marty's family from the first 1985 seemed almost poor and just another local family and how Marty in 1955 made his father stand up for himself, if this never happened then George most likely would never have become rich and famous. So even though there was no \"butterfly effect\" there still is a mild one, but it was mild enough not to change the future drastically.\n\nDoc wouldn't \"already\" know Marty in 1955. In the original history, Doc and Marty met by some unknown series of events, purely by happenstance (Doc perhaps taking an ad out in the paper for a lab assistant/grunt, for example; and Marty happened to answer it). Ultimately, as a result of this incidental meeting and friendship, Marty goes back in time, where he meets Doc ahead of the original sequence of events (ahead of time for Doc at least). Now as time moves forward in the new timeline, Doc knows of Marty and that they'll eventually meet; but he may still not know how. Because Doc's aware of possible repercussions of knowing about your own future, he probably wouldn't have asked Marty how they met, not would he have sought out Marty prematurely; instead patiently waited for events to occur naturally, being pleasantly surprised when it finally did happens (Such as Doc taking out an ad, only to find and recognize Marty answering the ad.)"], ["Did 'Biff' really get buried in manure?", "No, they used peat moss as a substitute in the scene where manure gets dumped on Biff's ('Thomas F.

In tears, Marty rushes over to help Doc and is surprised when he suddenly sits up unharmed, revealing a bulletproof vest under his clothes. Turns out that Doc taped back together Marty's letter of warning and was prepared for the Libyan attack. After dropping Marty off at home, Doc announces that he's going to take a trip into the future...maybe about 30 years hence. Marty awakens the next morning thinking that it was all a nightmare and is shocked to see that his family has changed. His house is tastefully decorated, his parents are 'cool', his father is a published author, and Biff is outside waxing the family cars. As Marty opens the garage to see his own Toyota 4x4, his girlfriend Jennifer Parker ('Claudia Wells' (qv)) drops by, and they share a kiss. Suddenly, an explosion is heard, and the DeLeoan comes to a screeching halt in the driveway. Doc gets out and tells Marty to get in the car. While he rummages through a garbage can to fill up the car's Mr Fusion Home Energy Reactor with 'fuel', he explains that something has to be done about their kids, requiring they go back to the future. All three pile back into the DeLorean, and Doc backs it out on the street. When Marty warns Doc to back up a bit further so that they can get enough road to reach the speed they need, Doc replies, 'Roads? Where we're going, we don't need roads!' The DeLorean begins to hover and flies away."], ["Why were the Libyans after Doc Brown?", "Doc explains early on in the film that, although the time machine runs on electricity, it needs a nuclear reactor to produce the 1.21 gigawatts needed to generate the electricity. Consequently, he made a deal with some Libyan nationalists. They provided him with stolen plutonium in exchange for a bomb. But Doc kept the plutonium and give them a bomb casing made of used pinball machine parts. In 1985, diplomatic relations between the United States and the North African country of Libya were highly strained, with Libya's then-president Muammar Gaddafi expressing very angry anti-American sentiment to the world and the US's then-president Ronald Reagan countering that he wouldn't tolerate terrorist threats from Gaddafi. Having Doc make an illegal deal with a couple of Libyan \"nationals\" (as he puts it) for the stolen plutonium makes for a convenient story item that reflects the time period. In the years after the film, US-Libyan relations would turn violent with Libya sponsoring a terrorist bombing of a West German club which American soldiers frequented. In retaliation, the US bombed the cities of Benghazi and Tripoli in Libya, killing Gaddafi adopted daughter, among others. The escalating violence climaxed in 1988 when Libyan terrorists placed a bomb on Pan Am Flight 103, which exploded over Lockerbie, Scotland, killing over 200 people."], ["Why did Marty's entire family change but not him?", "Most people agree that the Marty we see going back in time at the end of Part 1 grew up in the new timeline with a wealthy family, and would have had a different personality. As for his memories, there are two schools of thought. One school believes that, due to the ripple effect, time needs to catch up, so Marty's personality would get rewritten and he would get his new memories as well. Eventually he would remember not having been surprised to see the truck, and the timeline might change slightly to reflect his resulting actions. The other school believes that Marty's memories would not change, the reason being that, while time traveling, Marty was outside his timeline and thus not affected by any changes he made, other than physical ones. There's an extension of the self-preservation theory that says the space-time continuum would naturally try to prevent paradoxes like these. It should be noted that Marty in the beginning of the film has a problem with sending the demo to a record company because of low self-confidence, as opposed to the ending of the film where a short scene shows him preparing the letter - just before he meets his siblings Dave and Linda at the breakfast table."], ["Why did Doc tape the letter back together?", "It seems odd that Doc would be so against having knowledge of the future, but then later piece together a letter he knows details future events. So why the change of heart? Doc did stuff the ripped letter back into his pocket so he obviously knew that it might contain important information. There are three ideas and the final answer may even be a hybrid of these: (1) The most obvious reason is as Doc states, \"What the hell.\" He was simply curious and it saved his life;; (2) The more subtle reason, being the intelligent person he is, is that Doc realized something went wrong. Notice how he many times he replays the part of the tape where his future self says, \"They found me. I don't know how they found me. Run for it Marty!\" That, in addition to Marty obviously being unprepared to travel through time and his insistence that he talk about the future, would be enough for Doc to realize that something went wrong; or (3) Marty relays to Doc that his dad laid out Biff. Marty said, \"He never stood up to Biff in his life!\" Doc whispers, \"Never? In his life?\" and the look on his face looked like a moment of epiphany. He must have realized at that point that since Marty had already altered the future, maybe changing the future isn't so bad as long as it's for the better."], ["By the end of BTTF1, shouldn't two Martys exist in 1955? Twin Pines Marty and Lone Pine Marty?", "Maybe not. BTTF2 suggests that the answer is: no. At the end of BTTF1, when Marty re-enters in 1985 few minutes before Doc would be killed, we can see the \"younger\" self of Marty departing from 1985. \"That\" Marty is the so-called \"Lone Pine Marty\", the Marty raised by the successful new versions of his parents. Thus, his memories and experiences are very different from the Twin Pines Marty's ones. So where did he end if in 1955 there's already one Marty operating, Twin Pines Marty? We must assume that in 1955 Lone Pine Marty just \"replaced\" Twin Pines Marty and did things the same exact way his previous counterpart did in BTTF1. The \"Marty operating in 1955\" we see in BTTF2 is indeed Lone Pine Marty. Finally, we must assume that at some point, maybe just moments before the very end of BTTF1 when Doc came from the future to \"save Marty and Jennifer's kids\", Twin Pines Marty disappeared and was replaced by Lone Pine Marty with a whole new set of memories.

True, he played a major role in their lives since he was the one who helped them get together, but they didn't actually spend a lot of time with him. If they did notice the resemblance it's likely they chalked it up to coincidence, rather than assuming that their son, who they had known for his entire life, was the same man they had met earlier.

However, Marty is only about 17 years old in 1985 and it has been thirty years since George or Lorraine knew Calvin."], ["Why didn't George and Lorraine name their first son Marty?", "Lorraine said that she liked the name Marty, but that doesn't automatically mean that she intended to name any of her children that. Dave McFly could have been named after someone else, like George's dad (who we never see or hear the name of) or some other relative not mentioned in the films, or even a friend. Maybe they just liked the name David more.

They have stated in interviews that if they'd really had plans for a sequel, they would have left Jennifer out of the final scene, since the character would only slow things down (which is why Jennifer is so quickly 'discarded' in the beginning of Part II). However, when the original proved very successful and the studio announced that they were going to make a sequel anyway, Zemeckis and Gale preferred to be involved on their own terms. 'To Be Continued' was added to the video version before Part II came out. That was the first inkling most people had that there would be a sequel. This unexpected addition resulted in a great deal of speculation which, of course, turned out to be true.

His entire existence comes into being on the 5th of November 1955, when he arrived in the past. When the erasure is complete, this is not really Marty, but just an echo of him, whose sole function is to erase him from existence. So the timelines go: Timeline A: Marty is born, 1985; Marty goes back in time, 1985. Timeline B (final timeline): Marty arrives out of nowhere in 1955 and erases himself from existence. He vanishes.\n\n2) Alternate Universes (NOTE: The _Back to the Future_ (qv) writers say that there are no alternate universes involved in the trilogy, but this is just to show a different solution to the paradox.) Marty goes back in time. He makes it such that he was never born. But this does not cause him to fade from existence. The photograph will not show his siblings disappearing. He spends his time in 1955 oblivious of what he has done, but when he goes back to the future, he discovers a world in which he never existed. Marty spends the rest of his life wandering the planet as a stranger whom no one knows, except maybe as an old schoolmate from long ago in 1955.\n\n3) The Self-Preservation Effect (SPE) Marty goes back in time and erases himself from existence. 1985 comes along, and he is never born. There is no Marty to go back in time and ensure that he is never born. To prevent a paradox and prevent itself from blowing up, the space-time continuum makes sure that Marty is never born through other ways. Maybe George is instantly killed when Sam's car hits him. Maybe Lorraine spontaneously bursts into flames. Maybe a fire starts out at the school dance before they get a chance to fall in love. And so on, at the end of which Marty is never born.\n\n4) The Universe Blows Up It's the most convenient of the lot.

It is sure, however, that it could not have been the uncut version shown at the premiere in Berlin. With its length of 153 minutes (at a speed of 24p) the movie was just too long for most publishers. This is why American audiences were shown a version cut by 30 minutes. After _Metropolis_ (qv) had been shown rather unsuccessfully in only one cinema in Berlin the movie was pulled out and re-released in a version which used the American cut as a starting point. This new version was then used as basis for other international exports. The cut material was probably destroyed instantly and the original version of the movie was lost. Lang himself called _Metropolis_ (qv) a movie which no longer existed. It was not before the Seventies that film historian Enno Patalas tried to find those lost scenes. After years of international research, a version could be put together in 1986/87 in Munich which was still cut but a big step forward from the then usual 1937 Museum of Modern Art version. Due to intertitles which were true to the original as well as descriptive texts and still pictures which replaced missing sequences and a montage very close to the original, the Patalas version was the best one could get until 2001. This was the year of a DVD release, which relied a lot on the Patalas version but used modern reconstruction methods and better quality material. However, probably nobody believed in the reappearance of the premiere version.\n\nAnd so the surprise was huge when in early 2008 a significantly longer version surfaced in Argentina. This sensational find could be traced back to a copy which an Argentinian publisher had bought after the movie's premiere in 1927 directly from Ufa in order to use it in his own country. Following contemporary habits this copy should have been destroyed directly after use, but due to lucky circumstances it did not share this fate with the other copies and ended up as part of a private collection. From there, it had been rented and shown to small groups of people for decades until the collection was given to the national art fund in Argentina. For fire safety reasons, the highly inflammable 35mm nitro rolls were copied onto 16mm and then destroyed. More than thirty years later the negative came to Germany, where Anke Wilkening (Friedrich-Wilhelm-Murnau-Stiftung) and Martin Koerber (Deutsche Kinemathek) used it as basis for the newest reconstruction. On the 12th of February 2010, more than 80 years after the original premiere, the now almost complete reconstruction of _Metropolis_ (qv) was shown in the Old Opera House in Frankfurt and on the Berlinale.\nA very detailed comparison between both versions with pictures can be found here (part 1) and here (part2)."], ["What kind of political views did Fritz Lang want to show in the film?", "Fritz Lang wanted to establish peace between socialist and communist movements in Germany and upper classes and entrepreneurs.

Even if that tube probably could've been helpful, they would only be useful for a limited time and not using for something every hour since Joy and Sadness had to return home so they can keep Riley in balance again. Another theory could be that Joy is worried about the responsibility to these cores of Riley if especially another emotion in the headquarters would touch some of them: Remember if another emotion would touch those cores (while Fear, Anger and Disgust were the only ones inside) there could be risks that those core memories would become into the ones that touches them. Ex: if Anger touches one of them they will become \"angry\" memories and thus can never be changed again.
