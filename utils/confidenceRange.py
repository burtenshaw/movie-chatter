This module defines a number of confidence ranges:

    high confidence: near certainty that this is an appropriate answer
    medium confidence: probably a good answer, but good matches in DB can score higher
    low confidence: potentially relevant, but prefer other adapters/DB
    no confidence: answer is almost certainly uselesss
